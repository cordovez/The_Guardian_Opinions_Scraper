We may have found a way", "author": "Catriona Crombie", "teaser": "An NHS trust’s attempts to bring a crucial drug to market itself is hopeful news for patients", "published": "Thu 16 May 2024 13.30 CEST", "content": "Healthcare should make people’s lives better. That fact can hardly be contested. Yet for some patients with rare diseases, commercial interests are dictating who gets to access life-saving treatment and who doesn’t. Pharmaceutical companies have long been driven by global demand and the potential for the highest profits. In the past two decades, the market has exploded: pharma revenues worldwide have exceeded $1tn. For patients with common conditions, this investment in healthcare can only be good news. But the narrow focus of this strategy means that, in the UK, the one in 17 of us who will at some point be affected by a rare condition risk being forgotten.That is until now. Healthcare providers, driven by a desire to make life-saving treatments more widely available, are increasingly finding new ways of getting them to patients for whom they would have previously been out of reach. Great Ormond Street hospital (Gosh) recently announced that it was taking the unprecedented step of attempting to obtain the licence itself for a rare gene therapy on a non-profit basis, after the pharmaceutical company that planned to bring it to market dropped out. If successful, it will be the first time that an NHS trust has the authorisation to market a drug for this kind of treatment. The move could act as a proof of concept for bringing drugs to UK patients that pharmaceutical companies aren’t willing to risk their profits on.It is estimated that 3.5 million people in the UK are living with a rare disease, and that 95% of these conditions lack an effective treatment. Fifty percent of rare diseases appear in childhood and 30% of children with a rare disease will die before their fifth birthday. This simply isn’t acceptable. We need to do more to find new treatments and get them to patients quickly and affordably.Gosh secured funding from charities, including my team, to bid for market authorisation for the treatment of “bubble baby” syndrome, a life-threatening condition that leaves patients without an immune system. If left untreated, it can be fatal within the first two years of life, with even the most common illnesses becoming deadly. But the new gene therapy allows affected children to live a normal life. Put simply, it is the difference between growing up or not.Investment decisions by pharmaceutical companies are complex and influenced by many factors, including policy and regulatory frameworks, upfront costs and clinical feasibility. Even if a drug is proven to be an effective treatment for disease, is shown to be safe and is expected to generate millions of pounds a year, sometimes it’s not enough for a company to justify the investment.This tension between patient benefit and profit has been a live debate since the inception of the pharmaceutical industry. However, in recent years there have been allegations of rampant profiteering at the cost of patients’ health. In 2015, Turing Pharmaceuticals increased the cost of a then 62-year-old life-saving drug called Daraprim, used to treat Aids, malaria and cancer, from $13.50 to $750 a pill. The decision caused outrage and the former CEO, Martin Shkreli, tried to justify the increase as bringing the price in line with other rare disease treatments. Of course, not all in the pharma industry behave in this way, but increasing the variety of ways drugs can be developed and marketed to patients will be hugely beneficial for the sector as a whole.The good news for women: a drug to limit hot flushes. The bad: it could cost you £430 a month | Devi SridharRead moreWe are also seeing many drugs for treating rare diseases being dropped or paused in their development because of concerns over their commercial viability. Earlier this year, researchers at the University of Manchester were forced to find alternative funding for a clinical trial of a new gene therapy for Hunter Syndrome (MPS II) – a devastating genetic condition that in severe cases carries a life expectancy of only 10 to 20 years. The trial was initially funded by a pharma company, which then discontinued its investment for “commercial reasons” and returned the licence to the university. Researchers turned to our charity, LifeArc, for help to ensure that the trial, which had raised the hopes of patients and their families, could continue.What we need are new business models for rare diseases that are win-wins: models that can deliver safe and effective drugs that don’t bankrupt healthcare systems. If governments, healthcare professionals, researchers and charities work in partnership, there is potential for us to reduce the often high costs of drug development and bypass big pharma business models altogether. Another solution is to create brand new routes for maintaining drug supply, as Gosh is pioneering.Big pharma will always play a vital role in getting medicines to patients, but bringing some control for the development of life-saving treatments into the hands of those with patients’ best interests at heart is something that the industry desperately needs, too. The real challenge, of course, is changing what success looks like within the pharmaceutical industry. If we can stop treating people as commodities and instead recognise that transforming patients’ lives is priceless, then we can ensure that more life-saving treatments are reaching those who desperately them.\n Dr Catriona Crombie is the head of rare disease at medical charity LifeArc\nExplore more on these topicsMedical researchOpinionPharmaceuticals industryDrugsHospitalsHealthNHScommentShareReuse this content", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/may/16/imagine-getting-life-saving-drugs-to-sick-people-without-relying-on-big-pharma-we-may-have-found-a-way"},
{"headline": "Catalans once longed for freedom from Spain. Now that doesn’t look so appealing", "author": "María Ramírez", "teaser": "With most voters in Catalonia rejecting independence-seeking parties, the pro-separatist chaos of 2017 is a distant memory", "published": "Thu 16 May 2024 08.00 CEST", "content": "For the first time since 1980, parties opposing Catalonia’s independence from Spain have the support of a majority of voters in the region. Elections last Sunday saw around 54% of the electorate return candidates from non-separatist parties across the political spectrum. The Socialist party scored a momentous victory for the first time.The vote appears to draw a line under a tumultuous decade marked by a 2017 rush to independence that led to an illegal referendum, a unilateral declaration of independence, mass protest and the country’s worst constitutional crisis since the restoration of democracy in 1975.The latest result shows that most Catalans don’t want a separate Catalan republic. Indeed, separatism was already in decline before this vote, but this is the first time the shift in opinion will be reflected clearly in the Catalan parliament. The vote aligned closely with new polling data gathered in February revealing that around 51% of the region’s population opposes independence, with 41% in favour and the remaining 8% either undecided or unresponsive.The Catalan autonomous region was created after the end of the Franco dictatorship – Franco largely suppressed regional autonomy. Today Catalonia, even more than the other autonomous Spanish regions, has considerable powers in healthcare, security and education.Despite autonomy, support for Catalan independence from Spain had steadily grown, reaching 49% in 2017.  Now, only around 30% of the population unambiguously tick an “independent state” as the best option for Catalonia when pollsters offer a range of nuanced hypothetical outcomes including independence within a federal Spain. Turnout was low in last Sunday’s vote: around 58%, compared with the 80% record of 2017. And this was most pronounced in areas that favour independence-supporting parties, as my colleagues at elDiario.es showed.Overall what the result points to is that the so-called procés (the “process” that separatist politicians embarked on to make Catalonia independent) may be dead, even if nationalist sentiment remains part of the culture and politics in Catalonia, as does the desire to break away from the rest of Spain.Family origin remains the most significant predictor of secessionist sympathies, according to an analysis from El País. Older, wealthier people, residents of rural communities and individuals with multi-generational ties to Catalonia tend to be more supportive of independence.Attachment to Catalan language and culture, which is also promoted by regional media and the public education system, is still very strong. Catalan identity is, however, now more inclusive of other identities. The percentage of citizens who say they feel “only Catalan” has declined from 29% in 2017 to the current 17%, while the share of those who say they feel both Catalan and Spanish has jumped from 35% to 44%.View image in fullscreenNational riot police preventing people from voting in a banned Catalan independence referendum in Barcelona, Spain, 1 October 2017. Photograph: Alberto Estévez/EPASo what has changed since 2017? Several factors contribute to this evolving landscape, including a widespread sense of disillusionment following the chaotic aftermath of the 2017 vote, which laid bare the practical consequences of a forced and potentially botched breakaway.Many people were alarmed by the lack of planning for independence and transparency surrounding the secessionists’ plans that became evident in 2017. Carles Puigdemont, president of Catalonia at the time and now leader of the rightwing Junts party, declared unilateral independence after a vote with no legal consequences and a few seconds later announced it could not be applied. Then, as he was suspended by the national government, he fled the country, ending up in Brussels, to avoid the legal consequences of his actions. Some of his colleagues in government were tried and went to jail. A fractured society suffered years of protests and conflict that permeated families, workplaces and public debates in Catalonia and across Spain.Since then, concerns about the independence issue have been replaced in most people’s minds by pressing global problems (from the pandemic to the threat of war) and local ones such as a crisis in public services provision and a prolonged drought. Tensions between the opposing camps in the independence debate have declined too. In pardoning the jailed politicians the central government led by Pedro Sánchez has adopted a more conciliatory approach than the conservative administration led by his predecessor Mariano Rajoy. On the Catalan side, new separatist leaders, particularly Pere Aragonès from the leftist ERC, have also adopted a more pragmatic, conciliatory tone.Sánchez’s amnesty law would include the still fugitive and exiled Puigdemont in exchange for his party’s support in the Spanish parliament. This has reignited the controversy, but mostly outside Catalonia. Within the region, most people either support the amnesty or don’t care about it. Sánchez’s strategy seems to be paying off in normalising a dysfunctional relationship. Local trains, unaffordable housing, school performance, unsustainable tourism and immigration were more prominent issues in the regional elections than the amnesty.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to This is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A mild-mannered former health secretary in the Spanish government during the pandemic who has a background in philosophy and worked in local government in Barcelona for years, Illa promised after his victory, in Spanish, to include all Catalans, “no matter what they think, no matter what language they speak, no matter where they live and no matter what they come from”. Not the usual message you hear from politicians in Catalonia.Still, it’s not clear whether he will manage to secure a majority in the Catalan parliament, where eight parties are represented and where rightwing parties have advanced, including a new far-right, Islamophobic pro-independence party.Puigdemont is still making an unlikely bid to become president of Catalonia, perhaps in exchange for supporting Sánchez’s national government. Often lucky, Sánchez may pull it off somehow. But rosier times in Catalonia could come at the expense of harder horse-trading in Madrid. Political deadlock and another election in Catalonia is still possible despite Illa’s topping the poll.Nevertheless, politics now reflects what reality on the ground has shown for a long time, and not just in Catalonia. Most people don’t want political disruption, let alone revolution. They distrust sovereigntist and isolationist fantasies, and have limited interest in partisan, divisive battles. Politicians, including messianic leaders, should acknowledge that.\n María Ramírez is a journalist and deputy managing editor of elDiario.es, a news outlet in Spain\nExplore more on these topicsCataloniaOpinionSpainEuropecommentShareReuse this content", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/may/16/catalan-catalonia-spain-independence-voters-separatist"},
{"headline": "Claims that British unions harm economic growth have one tiny flaw. They’re 100% wrong", "author": "Larry Elliott", "teaser": "Restrictions on collective power led to decades of exploitation and stagnant pay for workers. Why not try another way?", "published": "Thu 16 May 2024 11.00 CEST", "content": "Profiteering is nothing new. Stanley Baldwin had a pithy description for the new intake of Conservative MPs at the 1918 general election, noting that they were “a lot of hard-faced men who look as if they had done very well out of the war”. The future Tory prime minister was right. Many companies had found a war economy greatly to their liking, securing lucrative government contracts and making a mint in the process. Profiteering was rampant.Sharon Graham, the general secretary of the Unite union, says something similar has been happening since the war on Covid began in 2020. A study of the reports and accounts of almost 17,000 firms – big and small – showed that pre-tax profit margins were, on average, 30% higher in 2022 than they were in the years immediately before the pandemic began.The UK’s inflation rate peaked at just over 11% in 2022 and, judging by the Unite research, many companies took the opportunity to increase their prices by more than was necessary to cover rising costs, on the basis that consumers wouldn’t notice that they were being gouged.Workers have fared less well. For the past few months, as the annual inflation rate has come down, real incomes have been going up because wages have been rising faster than prices. But this welcome improvement in living standards cannot make up for the deep real wage cuts earlier in the cost of living crisis and, in any event, is likely to be a brief interlude unless there are changes to the way the economy operates. As Graham notes, companies can get away with fattening their profit margins because they have the power to do so. “What’s happened in the last three years is, underneath it all, a major redistribution of wealth away from workers’ wages to corporate profits.”Unions think companies have too much power while they have too little, and that’s one reason they took such a hard line this week with Keir Starmer over Labour’s new deal for workers. The planned expansion of workers’ rights promises to shift the balance of power between labour and capital modestly in favour of the former, but no more than that. After unions made clear this was a totemic issue for them, Starmer said Labour was sticking with the planned reforms.UK firms accused of profiteering as study finds margins rose 30% post-pandemicRead moreThere are three counter-arguments to the points made by Unite in its profiteering report, and by the unions more generally. The first is that different profit numbers can be arrived at using different methodology, so there is nothing really to see here. The second is that corporate profits are vital, because they are the source of investment that creates the jobs of the future. The third is that handing more power to unions threatens to wreck Britain’s flexible labour market and will cost jobs.The first argument would be more convincing if Unite’s report was a one-off, but the same picture emerges from elsewhere in the world. In 2021, US profit margins for non-financial companies reached their highest level since the second world war. The European Central Bank’s president, Christine Lagarde, said last year that companies in the eurozone were taking advantage of high inflation to plump up their profit margins. At the very least, there is a case for UK plc to answer.Nor is there any real evidence of a link between profits and investment. Rather, as a paper by the left-of-centre thinktank Common Wealth points out, the bulk of the profits are finding their way to shareholders through dividends, rather than into new capital spending.Back in the 1970s, when unions had considerably more power than they enjoy today, private non-financial corporations paid out 20p in dividend payments for every £1 of gross fixed-capital formation. In the second half of the 2010s, this figure was 95p. Payouts to shareholders rose two and a half times faster than total employee compensation between 1988 and 2019. Meanwhile, business investment over that period has been consistently lower than the average for leading industrial nations.The original justification for putting restrictions on unions and boosting corporate power was that it would boost growth by stimulating entrepreneurship and create more, better-paid jobs.In practice, a lack of union protection left workers wide open for exploitation. Companies were always able to find people to work for low wages, particularly once they found they could tap into global pools of migrant workers. Real wages – even after the recent small increase – have flatlined since the time of the global financial crisis in 2008.Labour and unions reach agreement on workers’ rights proposalsRead moreSo the idea that Britain’s flexible labour market represents some sort of gold standard for international best practice is a nonsense. The fact that labour is so cheap discourages firms from investing in new kit and in developing the skills of their workers so that they are truly flexible rather than – as they all too often are – easily dispensable.Graham’s assessment is that life is sweet for those at the top but tough for workers, and it is hard to disagree with her. The UK has a poor record for investment, a poor record for productivity, a poor record for real wage growth and, since the pandemic, a poor record for employment. Britain’s workforce is 900,000 smaller than it was before the pandemic, in part due to inactivity caused by long-term sickness and ill health.The “flexibility” model is based on fear, insecurity and poverty pay, and it has failed.

{"headline": "Our democracy desperately needs a reset – and, behind the scenes, that’s the plan", "author": "Martin Kettle", "teaser": "This is a seismic moment as Westminster prepares for power to pass from one party to another. It will affect everything in some way", "published": "Thu 16 May 2024 07.00 CEST", "content": "The Conservative party’s lurch into collective hyperventilation after 2016 gave Britain five prime ministers in eight years. Yet changes of government from one party to another are actually remarkably rare. There have been only three of them in the past half century: to the Tories in 1979, to Labour in 1997 and then back to the Tories in 2010. Lucy Powell, the shadow leader of the House of Commons, pointed out in a speech this week that, at the age of 49, she has only witnessed two changes of UK party government in her adult life; someone aged 30 will not have witnessed a single one in their voting life.More on Powell’s speech later. But her observation about the rarity of change underlines something distinctive as well as something important. Britain’s rare changes of regime make it something of an outlier. In the US, Canada and Spain over the same half century, there have been seven such changes to Britain’s three. In France and Germany, there have been five. Change is just that bit rarer in the UK, and for that reason it may in some ways be a bigger deal.This is worth emphasising, because Britain appears to be on the threshold of another of those rare change moments. Our democratic ethos and institutions understand, in principle and without challenge, the legitimacy of such a change of party government. But it has now been so long since there has actually been one that a change of this kind, with Labour set to take over after 14 years of Conservative government, will be a genuine shock to the system and to the ideas, habits and careers of many of those who work in it.Conservatives mark 200 constituencies as vulnerable in next general electionRead moreLooking at the political landscape, it is easy to miss how much preparation is already taking place for this change. It may seem, especially if you watch prime minister’s questions, as though politics in 2024 is stuck in a succession of relentlessly repeated pre-election campaign slogans and manoeuvres. Much of this, though, is simply froth. Dig down deeper and the sense of multiple cultures, not just in politics, actively attempting to adjust to the likelihood of systemic change is very clear indeed.Powell’s speech this week illustrated this in two respects. First, because it was given to the Institute for Government, the non-partisan Whitehall thinktank that makes a speciality – among other things – of monitoring Labour’s preparations for government. And second because, speaking as shadow Commons leader, her speech aired some of Labour’s emerging thinking about the role of parliament, which is simultaneously Britain’s most important institution and its most reviled.The speech was not awash with revelations, and Powell could not compete with the procedural nerdiness of some of those present. Yet she only had to rehearse her three stated priorities – improving parliamentary workplace culture, strengthening MPs’ scrutiny of the legislative programme and restoring trust and respect towards parliament – to show that, if they could convincingly be put into practice, these plans could mark a huge change in the way the House of Commons works, and could improve the reputation of politics. Not before time, in either case.It will matter – of course it will – who gets into Keir Starmer’s cabinet, what jobs they will do, what training they have had, what scope they will have, whether they are allowed to stay in their posts, and whether they prove up to the task. But a change of government does not mean just a different lineup. It also means a different everyone else and, in some ways, a different everything too.We should think of this instead as a grand national reset. Much of it is already taking place, silently but inexorably, among those who will be most directly involved. Labour has been officially talking to civil servants since February. But the process is far more extensive and self-generated than that.Talk to any mandarin, and the conversation quickly turns to who will get the top jobs, in particular the cabinet secretary role, where some of the smart money is on the former John Lewis boss Sharon White. Several permanent secretaries will be eased out, as having hitched themselves too ambitiously to the current regime. Recruiting more scientists and stopping the churn of jobs are said to be Starmer’s priorities. The name of Sue Gray, Starmer’s tough-talking chief of staff, is omnipresent in these conversations.What should Labour learn from Sadiq Khan? Take a stand – and don’t back down | John McTernanRead moreThe civil service is not alone in preparing for change. So are the devolved authorities, local government and the quangos. Even the normally remote senior judges of the supreme court have made plans to offer training in the rule of law to members of the new parliament. Foreign governments know change is coming, and are preparing to deal with Labour. Businesses know it too, and have been lobbying for months. Financial markets have expectations of change baked in. Trade unions are flexing their muscles – as this week’s policy meeting with Starmer indicated. Campaigners are honing their Labour contacts. Likewise journalists.Indeed, the more carefully one surveys the political landscape, the more varied activity of this kind one encounters. Jockeying for jobs is only part of it. In some areas, the arguments about policy remain intense. For instance, Starmer has already hinted that the devolution of power will be central to his “missions”. That’s a big idea for a still highly centralised country such as Britain. But what exactly could it – and should it – involve?There is an unresolved behind-the-scenes battle within Labour on this. It will have been on the agenda when Starmer met his party’s mayors this week. Much of the focus is on English devolution. Should this involve mayors for everyone, treating somewhere like Wiltshire the same as a city region like Greater Manchester? Instinctive centralisers, not unknown in Labour, as well as a lot of Whitehall self-interest, says yes.But not everywhere is the same, or has the same statutory powers, and local spending is still under the cosh. Perhaps a better, if messier, system could evolve more organically. In a paper published on Wednesday by the all-party Constitution Reform Group, two former ministers – Labour’s John Denham and the Conservatives’ David Lidington – advocate a national devolution framework body for England to bring central and local government together in a more adaptive way. Starmer would be smart to read it.Don’t underestimate this moment. A change of government for Britain will be a big and fascinating process. It will affect – well, almost everything in some way. It will be rare enough and consequential enough to be this nation state’s equivalent of a birth, a marriage or moving home. Life-changes of this kind need to be prepared for, and that is happening. But, like the future, they can never be wholly foreseen.

{"headline": "Yes, Rishi Sunak, the world is a scary place. That is why we need a new prime minister", "author": "Rafael Behr", "teaser": "With no domestic legacy to celebrate, the PM has little choice but to focus on global volatility. But that is a problem he can’t solve", "published": "Wed 15 May 2024 07.00 CEST", "content": "On the eve of the last general election, no one was debating what to do in the event of a pandemic, or if Russia invaded Ukraine, or the Middle East exploded. If the recent past contains clues about the near future, Britain’s next prime minister will soon be grappling with some as yet unforeseen global emergency. Plus the already visible crises.Where most people see dangers amassing on the horizon, Rishi Sunak reads simplistic campaign slogans. For want of a domestic legacy to celebrate, the prime minister has decided to put global volatility at the centre of his pitch for re-election. He rehearsed the line in a speech on Monday. The world is a scary place, he said. Only the Tories can keep you safe.The first half of the proposition is indisputable. Vladimir Putin has burned all bridges of trust between Russia and its neighbours. Israel and Iran, already antagonists by proxy, are a hair-trigger away from open war.China will continue to rival the US for global influence. Tension between the established superpower and the ascendant one will inflame disputes over tariffs and technology transfers. The US will tilt further towards protectionism. The EU will react by accelerating its pursuit of what Brussels policymakers call “strategic autonomy”. Other rising powers, India principal among them, will game the unsettled balance of global power for tactical advantage and commercial gain.This all poses unique challenges to a country that recently exiled itself from its local continental power bloc. Brexit was a huge bet against the idea that geography mattered to economic and security policy in the 21st century. Geography won.Sunak has nothing meaningful to say about that problem. He can only list menaces beyond Britain’s borders and accuse Keir Starmer of lacking the gumption to take them on. The charge has two elements. First, Labour still harbours the Nato-sceptic, pacifist impulses that shaped Jeremy Corbyn’s worldview. Second, the opposition won’t mimic Conservative pledges on defence spending.The reality is that Starmer has purged the Corbynite left from Labour with a ruthlessness that Sunak has failed to deploy against cranks and maniacs on the right. Naming former leaders who should never have been allowed near Downing Street is hardly comfortable territory for the party of Liz Truss.As for defence spending, the real difference between Labour and the Tories is that the latter are relaxed about making up big numbers because they don’t expect to have to find the money after an election.Sunak conjures up billions in future defence budgets by assuming cuts to other departments that no one familiar with the parlous state of public services thinks are feasible. It is the same accounting trick that the Tories use to “fund” tax cuts, all in the hope of trapping Labour in fiscal fictions or exposing it to charges of nefarious intent with public money.Defence spending will be a priority for Labour in government because Nato needs the money and European democracies need Nato as their insurance policy against Kremlin aggression more than at any time since the cold war. Starmer’s commitment to that cause is not some electoral feint. It is a renewal of vows with the pre-Corbyn tradition of unambiguously pro-western alignment espoused by every past Labour prime minister. (It was Clement Attlee who first took Britain into Nato.)It is true that any decision to prioritise rearmament will inflame resentment on the left. But Sunak is wrong to think that Starmer and Rachel Reeves will flinch from the task. More likely, they will press on, resulting in a steady drift of disillusioned Labour supporters to the Liberal Democrats (as happened under Tony Blair) and, following the pattern of recent local election results, to the Greens.The predictable geometric consequence of Starmer governing from the centre is an insurgent opposition on the left rising in symmetry with increasingly paranoid populism on the right. A demoralised, defeated Conservative party will be vulnerable to capture by the faction that sees migration as the root of all national ills and international treaties as an offence against sovereignty.If Donald Trump is elected US president in November, many Tories will be drawn into orbit around him, cutting what flimsy ties still bind them to multilateral institutions and the rule of law. Neither the current Tory leader, nor any prospective replacement, would resist that tendency. If, as Sunak claims, the question on the ballot paper at the election is how best to safeguard Britain’s democratic values, the correct answer is to banish the Tories to opposition.What these calculations reveal, above all, is the impossibility of disentangling foreign and security policy from domestic politics. The two have always been linked, not least by the way financial markets, moved by world affairs, can jam levers of national economic policy.But intensification of global volatility tightens the feedback loop. Russia invades Ukraine and household energy bills spike. War in Gaza brings thousands of people on to the streets in London, demanding things that the British politicians are powerless to deliver.Conflict anywhere on Europe’s periphery becomes a refugee crisis that animates anxiety about migration. The operation of international law becomes a front in the culture war between liberal defenders of human rights and nationalists demanding border control at any price. And that is before the climate crisis, as a driver of migration and a bill that national governments dread imposing on their taxpayers, is fed into the equation.It would be wrong to say British politics is ignoring these issues. They were all in Sunak’s speech somewhere, just not arranged into any coherent analysis. David Cameron cuts a serious figure as foreign secretary. He is enjoying the restoration of the stately pomp to which he has always felt entitled. But he is no freer than the prime minister to speak candidly about the chain of strategic miscalculations that have landed Britain in its present predicament.On the Labour side, David Lammy, the shadow foreign secretary, has written thoughtfully about shifting global power balances and the need to shed complacent illusions cultivated in the era of western hegemony. But it is hard to know what his doctrine of “progressive realism” actually means until it is tested by dilemmas in government.Some hard choices are predictable – how to handle Trump; how far and how fast to realign with the EU; where to draw the line between rivalry and threat from China. But seeing the questions in advance doesn’t make them any easier. And that is before the next unforeseen crises that will define the second half of this decade just as pandemic and wars have shaped the first.Amid so much uncertainty, and so little political will to grapple with it, I offer two safe bets: first, the election will not be decided on the question of which party leader has the more credible strategic concept of Britain’s place in the world. Second, that question more than any other will decide whether the next prime minister succeeds or fails.\n Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnist\nExplore more on these topicsPoliticsOpinionRishi SunakKeir StarmerConservativesLabourForeign policycommentShareReuse this content", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/may/15/rishi-sunak-world-dangerous-election-tories-labour"},

They underpin the targeting of Jewish people, whatever their views on the conflict in Gaza", "published": "Thu 16 May 2024 09.00 CEST", "content": "A few weeks ago, my teenage son was in a library revising for his exams. A woman sat down opposite, looked at the star of David necklace he has recently started wearing and glared at him. Then she placed her water bottle between them with its “Boycott Israeli Apartheid” sticker turned to face his way.She didn’t speak to my son. She didn’t ask what he thinks about Israel, Gaza, Netanyahu or Hamas. She doesn’t know whether he has friends or relatives who have been taken hostage or killed (he doesn’t), or if he has been on any pro-Palestine marches (he hasn’t). Whether it is antisemitic or not to boycott Israel is beside the point. She seemed to be triggered by the simple sight of a Jew. There’s no more basic expression of racism than that.As microaggressions go, it’s not much. However, when Muslim women – for example – are harassed for wearing a hijab, it tends to come from people with far-right sympathies. In contrast, this woman had an “antifa” sticker on display. I’m also an anti-fascist. When the neo-Nazi terrorist David Copeland was planting his nail bombs around London, I was the contact for the mole inside the far right who identified him to the police. Something has gone badly wrong in the intervening years if this is how some young anti-fascists now react to Jews.The idea that Jews are local proxies for Israel, answerable for its deeds and suitable targets for the anger it attracts, can be lethal. In Zurich, a Jewish man was stabbed repeatedly in the street. In Berlin, a synagogue was firebombed. In Canada, shots were fired at Jewish schools. In London, a group of Israelis were attacked by a gang who heard them speaking Hebrew and asked “Are you Jewish?” Perhaps my son was lucky it was only a sticker.These violent episodes are the exception. But hostility towards Jews is there in the daily abuse, threats, graffiti and online posts that make up a record rise in the UK in antisemitic hate incidents that began the moment Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October. For younger Jews at school or university, you can throw social isolation into the mix. Fears that Jewish life in Britain is becoming untenable are overblown but, for a community numbering about 300,000, the mood music is full of foreboding.At the same time, a global protest movement of rare size and emotional potency has filled our streets, social media and campuses. These two phenomena – the anti-Jewish hate crimes and the anti-Israel protests – rise and fall together like clockwork every time Israel is at war, in a way that does not happen for any other overseas conflict. This doesn’t mean that every protester is antisemitic: far from it. Many have honourable motivations, and heaven knows there is plenty to despair about in Gaza. Still, the correlation between the protests and the hate crimes is striking. The Austrian Holocaust survivor Jean Améry wrote in the 1960s that “anti-Zionism contains antisemitism like a cloud contains a storm”. This storm has been raging for months.This is not where Jews want to be, with this ancient hatred that ought to reside only in history books making headlines every week. A UK home secretary – who accused the police of handling pro-Palestinian protests too leniently - and mealy mouthed university presidents in the US – who seemed unable to unreservedly condemn those on campus who call for the genocide of Jews - lost their jobs in the throes of it. Political and media rows rage for days because of it. Past generations of British Jews have traditionally stayed well below the parapet, getting on with life in a very British way. Now it feels like we are permanently under the microscope.This is not only a problem on the left, or just about Israel. Last month, a teenage neo-Nazi was convicted of planning to bomb a synagogue in Brighton. Elon Musk described as “the actual truth” the far-right conspiracy theory that Jews incite hatred against white people. Activists with huge online followings get millions of views for social media posts that would not be out of place in the Nazi propaganda rag Der Stürmer. When this much antisemitism is in the air, it’s hard not to breathe it in.Why this happens demands a much broader answer. Many of the most common anti-Jewish myths and stereotypes – the association with money and power, of inhumane cruelty and blood lust, the belief that Jews kill children for fun or religion – are centuries old. Together, they offer a way of interpreting our world that depicts Jews as the antithesis, and the main threat, to whatever society deems to be good, moral and humane.Given this history, it should not surprise us that a protest movement that treats the world’s only Jewish state as a transgressor of all moral and human norms attracts some people who do not like Jews. All those placards alleging a “Palestinian Holocaust”, the “Gaza” graffiti on a sign attached to the railings of the Wiener Holocaust Library in London, “SS IDF” daubed in red paint on my late parents’ synagogue: this particular slander is the latest version of the same old charge that frames Jews as a demonic presence that pollutes our world. Those who were once condemned as Christ-killers are now cursed as genocidal Nazis.Most Jews and Palestinians want peace. Extremists, narcissists ​and other ‘allies’ only block the way | Jonathan FreedlandRead moreJews know all of this, but it seems that everyone else has forgotten it. Like hikers following a well-trodden trail across unfamiliar terrain, most people who fall for these ideas are not cranks or fools: they are just part of our world where these assumptions and myths about Jews are woven into the fabric. Nor do you need to wander to the wildest fringes to find them: they reside in Shakespeare, Chaucer and Voltaire. There is the writings of Henry Ford. Or, for that matter, the comments of Kanye West (who talked of “going death con 3 On JEWISH PEOPLE” and praised Hitler, before later offering an apology). Antisemitism is the product of some of history’s finest minds and most talented creators. No wonder it proves so popular and enduring.There is a well-worn metaphor that Jews are the canary in the coalmine, with antisemitism an early indicator of invisible problems in society. I’m not a fan of this metaphor because it presumes the canary is expendable. Nevertheless, it reflects a deeper truth. Antisemitism has a fluid quality, filling whatever space is opened to it, seeping into the cracks and widening them further. It has dominated conversation among British Jews since 7 October to an unprecedented extent – but really, it is everyone else who needs to think about what it means.\n Dave Rich is the author of Everyday Hate: How Antisemitism is Built Into Our World and How You Can Change It, which is published in an updated edition on 16 May\n\n Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

I have a five-point plan to fix that", "author": "Stephen Cowan", "teaser": "For so many millions, the home-owning dream has died. Labour must protect them, and reconstruct a dysfunctional housing market", "published": "Wed 15 May 2024 13.15 CEST", "content": "Sarah faces daily torment. An impending rent rise means she can no longer afford to live in the home she shares with her two children. She has to downsize. That means potentially having to split up her boys. Her youngest is doing his A-levels. Her oldest, just turned 18, is struggling with mental health issues. It is an unenviable problem.“Will I have to say that one son lives elsewhere and one lives with me,” asks Sarah (not her real name). “At best I can try to protect them and say it’s all going to be OK. But I have to say it to myself as well. But we’ve got no stability and could be thrown out in two months’ time.”Sarah’s plight is a story of modern Britain. Where once we were a nation of homeowners and those who rented from their local council, we now live in a land where a staggering 11 million people live in privately rented homes.The UK, despite Margaret Thatcher’s vision, now has some of the lowest rates of home ownership in Europe. And absolute numbers of social housing have crashed – with 1.4m fewer households living in social housing in England now than in 1980.None of this has been helped by the government’s housing policies. Between 2010 and 2020, England had the lowest number of new homes built since the end of the second world war.All this has meant that, for millions of people, the great British dream of a secure home of your own has been shattered. With that, the private rented sector (PRS) stepped up to become the second largest form of housing tenure in the UK.Since 1980, the numbers have doubled. Of the 5m properties, 21% are estimated to be below standards. Since 2010, the cost of renting has gone up by 44.5%, according to the Halifax. During this period, wages have risen by 30.4% and inflation has risen by 24%.No-fault evictions are going through the roof. Last year, there was an 49% rise over the previous year, with 9,457 households in England removed from their homes for no fault of their own. That is the highest level in seven years. More than 26,000 households have lost their homes since the government first announced it would ban section 21 notice evictions almost five years ago.UK failure to build social homes ‘shocking’, says author of 2004 reportRead moreThere are many good, highly professional landlords running high-quality business operations, and there are exceptionally compassionate landlords who go above and beyond to support their tenants. But there are others, too. The lower end of the sector is blighted by landlords who range from those who are “wilfully ignorant” to those involved in “organised crime”.Too much of the private housing market is not functioning properly. If some of these operations were healthcare or food businesses they would be closed down. Too many families are facing daily anguish and anxiety trying to deal with the basic right to have a decent roof over their heads.These are the inescapable conclusions of the independent private rented sector commission, which has just carried out a 17-month long independent review at the request of Labour.Not surprisingly, we affirm from the outset that fixing the dysfunctional housing sector is a good priority for Labour’s government-in-waiting. We believe Labour’s plans to restore housebuilding targets and to reform the planning system and the compulsory purchase compensation code are vital if we are to reshuffle the deck so that more people have the opportunity to live in either owned or socially provided housing.We have set out five key issues that we believe could help support a fit-for-purpose housing system.Currently, there is no precise means of measuring the safety or quality of homes across the private rented sector. So, acting upon the principle of “If you can’t measure it, you can’t manage it”, we’re calling for the introduction of a comprehensive, annually updated self-assessment on a new national landlords’ register. This would require landlords to detail compliance with health and safety laws and a new decent homes standard.Renters have a right to know that their home will be safe and of good standard. And good landlords have a right to compete in a market where everyone plays by the same rules. The register will enable those things to happen efficiently and quickly.We also call for the banning of no-fault evictions, and for actions to curtail the drift from long-term lets to short-term and holiday lets, such as Airbnb.Like the Labour party, our expert-led commission comes out strongly against hard rent controls, which it concludes are damaging to the PRS. Instead, we call for the introduction of a straightforward rent stabilisation measure already practised by some businesses in the PRS. That would manage in-tenancy rent increases – not a cap on rents, but a cap on rent increases. Crucially, it would close any potential loophole of rent-hike evictions.None of these proposals are radical. Much of Europe already offers renters these rights as a minimum. These pragmatic measures will enable government to nudge all parts of the private rented sector to uphold standards of professionalism in line with other consumer-based businesses. And they will give renters the stability they need to plan their lives. Britain’s renters deserve better. These measures would make that a reality.\n Stephen Cowan chaired the independent private rented sector commission and is leader of Hammersmith and Fulham council\nExplore more on these topicsRenting propertyOpinionSocial housingHousingcommentShareReuse this content", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/may/15/britons-exploitative-private-landlords-home-owning-labour-housing-market"},
{"headline": "It’s not pivotal that if the Donald is convicted Michael Cohen can sell his ‘Trump in jail’ T-shirts – but it’s not nothing", "author": "Emma Brockes", "teaser": "It has been fun watching the former president’s disreputable former lawyer coolly damn his one-time mentor in court", "published": "Thu 16 May 2024 12.00 CEST", "content": "There’s no justifying it, but I have a sneaky soft spot for Michael Cohen, the former lawyer, fixer and – as Fox News is keen to remind us – “ex-con” testifying against Donald Trump in the Stormy Daniels hush-money trial. Coming hard on the heels of Daniels’ explosive appearance last week, Cohen’s testimony could have been anticlimactic. Not so!The 57-year-old, navigating a tricky line between languid, affable and sheepish, met tough questioning by Trump’s lawyers with the calmness of a man with nothing to lose and a lot of unfinished business to get through. Cohen, you’ll remember, literally did time for those hush-money payments (among other things), so it’s fair to say he might have a few scores to settle.If Cohen’s return to court felt inevitable, it is in line with so many members of Trump’s former inner circle, all of whom, given time, seem to revolve back into view like the fish at Yo! Sushi. Cohen is one of an effective Marvel Universe of characters unleashed by the Trump administration who, eight years after Trump entered the White House, are serious contenders as our era’s lasting, historical villains.Among these Cohen, much like Anthony Scaramucci, the banker and Trump’s former press secretary, and – I’ll stick my neck out here – Rudy Giuliani, Trump’s former lawyer who is facing his own indictments plus a $148m defamation judgment against him, occupy the role of second-tier villains to main players such as Roger Stone, Steve Bannon and Paul Manafort (also back in the news this week, four years after being released from prison). As slapstick as they are rogueish, these guys could be extras in Bugsy Malone, or the great American novel Dickens never wrote. And if they are as opportunistic as everyone else in Trump’s world, you have to admit they are highly entertaining.In court this week Cohen, looking like the Fonz and sounding like the former personal injury lawyer from Long Island he is, somehow survived the defence team’s attempts to discredit him, and managed to land a series of blows on his former employer. It should not, in all honesty, have been so. Cohen, who in 2018 pleaded guilty to a combination of federal campaign violations he says he undertook on Trump’s behalf and tax evasion crimes all of his own, nonetheless presented in unruffled form a jaw-dropping account of how Trump got him to pay off Stormy Daniels, then covered up the payments.This is the crux of the case, and Cohen, assuming a mild air that somehow made his testimony all the more devastating, didn’t mince words. It reminded me of that bit in A Fish Called Wanda when Jamie Lee Curtis, in the witness box at the Old Bailey, says casually that, yes, she could be absolutely sure of what time her boyfriend had left the house because, “I was saying to myself, ‘It’s five to seven, where could he be going with that sawed-off shotgun?’”Mockery, low tactics, sexist tropes: gloriously, Stormy Daniels is repaying Donald Trump in kind | Emma BrockesRead moreThe shotgun in this case was a series of repayments allegedly made by Trump to Cohen, which Cohen says the former president was aware were being disguised as a legal retainer. Cohen smoothly shared details of a meeting he had with Trump in the Oval Office in 2017, in which he alleges Trump promised to repay Cohen the $130,000, which Cohen himself had already paid to Stormy Daniels. At later meetings, in the presence of Allen Weisselberg, the then chief financial officer for the Trump Organization, Cohen maintains Trump was present while the lie about the nature of these payments was cooked up. When asked by a prosecutor to confirm what, in fact, the 11 cheques paid to Cohen by Trump were for, he replied coolly. “The reimbursement to me for the hush-money fee.”The fact that Cohen reviles his former boss, loyalty to whom has cost him everything, should have been his second most undermining characteristic as a witness – after the fact he’s a convicted liar. Somehow, however, things didn’t pan out this way. Trump’s lawyers came at Cohen again and again as a bitter former employee seeking revenge. His vested interest in seeing Trump jailed – the maximum penalty for the charges Trump faces is four years in prison – was, at one unmatchable point in the proceedings, linked to the fact Cohen sells a line of T-shirts featuring an image of Trump behind bars. Nothing in fiction could improve upon this.Perhaps it is just a case of my enemy’s enemy, but watching the drama this week it was hard not to feel some warmth towards Cohen, a type of New York hustler whose entire career is on a par with those pilot fish who survive by nibbling plankton off a whale. Convicted liar though he may be, it’s striking to see him appear so soberingly honest about one thing. Trump’s lawyer, hoping to prove that Cohen is a compromised witness, at one stage read out some remarks Cohen had allegedly made about Trump that included calling him a “boorish cartoon misogynist” and a “Cheeto-dusted cartoon villain”. Lightly, Cohen responded, “Sounds like something I would say.”\n Emma Brockes is a Guardian columnist\n Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

{"headline": "Amsterdam is sick of ‘party tourists’. It should take drastic measures to stop them", "author": "Renate van der Zee", "teaser": "The city has had enough of stag parties and red-light gawpers. But it will take more than an online quiz to curb over-tourism", "published": "Wed 15 May 2024 08.00 CEST", "content": "An online quiz is the latest strategy with which Amsterdam hopes to deter nuisance tourists. The quiz is called Amsterdam Rules, and is meant to appear in search results about the city. It asks for the reasons why you desire to visit the Dutch capital. If you respond: for a stag party, a pub crawl or to smoke marijuana in public, you’ll be told that you will be disappointed, because it’s no longer allowed.The quiz is just one in a long series of experiments with which Amsterdam has tried to reduce the disruption caused by the hordes of tourists who come to the city to party wildly.This has included not only advertisements directed at potential tourists, but also concrete policy measures within the city. Advancing the closing times of bars in the red light district, for instance, has slightly improved things for residents. Others, such as the ban on smoking marijuana in public, are hard to enforce. And still others, such as restricting opening times for window brothels, were quickly reversed.As it stands, none of Amsterdam’s strategies have led to a real solution to the problem. The raw numbers tell the real story: the number of tourists continues to rise. In 2023, overnight stays increased by 21% to 9m. This brings Amsterdam back to pre-pandemic levels, while the city expects visitor numbers to reach record highs in the coming years.The big question now is: how much more is this relatively small city of 900,000 residents able to take? The narrow streets, alleyways and bridges in the fragile, historic 17th-century centre were simply never designed to allow large crowds of people to pass – even if they all behaved themselves. The everyday residents of the red light district feel crowded out by the throngs of tourists who sometimes even prevent them from reaching their homes.These residents scoff at the online quiz. Their fate is comparable to that of the Venetians who recently protested against the introduction of an entrance fee to the city of €5 for day trippers – another attempt to curb overtourism. They feel that it reduces the city to a theme park, and will not improve their day-to-day living conditions.Two years ago there was talk of adding access gates and entrance fees for the red light district. That plan was quickly abandoned: there are simply too many alleys that lead to the window brothels, and again, it explicitly presents the neighbourhood as a tourist park.This situation is not limited to Amsterdam and Venice. Across Europe, policymakers acknowledge that the number of tourists in many popular destinations is untenable, but cannot seem to address the root of the problem.The local politician Sofyan Mbarki believes the major problem is Amsterdam’s image as a place where anything goes. With the quiz, he hopes to change the way visitors think about the city. But the truth is that a problematic image can’t be changed overnight. You will actually have to adjust reality too.The mayor of Amsterdam, Femke Halsema, is aware of this. Five years ago, she boldly proposed closing the window brothels in the red light district – an audacious move considering that many local people still considered window prostitution an integral part of the city’s folklore. Gradually, more people are realising that what goes on in the red light district has nothing to do with folklore.Halsema has often faced fierce opposition. Interestingly, it was leftwing parties (including her own GreenLeft party) that resisted her plans. In 2021 she proposed another measure with substance: allowing only Dutch residents into coffee shops. Once again, the left resisted.Meanwhile, activists who fought overtourism for years have left the arena out of sheer frustration. They feel they are no match for the powerful lobby groups of entrepreneurs, who earn such high profits in the red light district that they can easily fund campaigns against unfavourable proposals from the mayor. In contrast, residents are fragmented into various small action groups with very little funding. Often they focus on the specific problems in their part of the neighbourhood, instead of the wider issue.Whether it’s Venice, Amsterdam or any other European city reeling from overtourism, one thing has become crystal clear: when faced with a dramatic problem, dramatic measures are needed. While Amsterdam’s conversation is often focused on the red light district and a certain kind of tourist, it simply isn’t enough to try to diminish the nuisance caused by one group: the overall volume of tourists needs to be addressed.This means deciding what a sustainable level of tourism really is – one that allows both visitors and local people to enjoy a city. To reach this, governments could significantly limit the flights and cruise ships that come to a city and the area around it. To curb overtourism in Amsterdam, downsizing Schiphol airport would be a great move – as it would simultaneously benefit the environment. While such plans were once on the table, the Dutch government regrettably put them on hold earlier this year.Implementing drastic measures requires courage. It requires courage to put a long-term vision for a livable city ahead of short-term economic interests. And it requires courage to face the wrath of the tourism sector, which wields an extremely strong lobby and only wants one thing: more tourism.\n Renate van der Zee is a Dutch writer and journalist\nExplore more on these topicsNetherlandsOpinionEuropeConservationHeritageVenicecommentShareReuse this content", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/may/15/amsterdam-party-tourists-online-quiz-city-tourism"},
{"headline": "The UK’s broken refugee policy is delivering vulnerable children into the hands of people smugglers", "author": "Alf Dubs", "teaser": "The government is preventing refugee families being reunited, but adopting one simple proposal could change that", "published": "Wed 15 May 2024 15.00 CEST", "content": "When I was a child, I had to leave my mother behind as I fled the Nazis on the Kindertransport. I still remember the moment my father met me at Liverpool Street station in London. My mother had been refused an exit permit, but at the last minute she managed to escape and joined my father and me in the city. Only then, all together, were we able to start rebuilding our lives.Sadly, many refugee children are torn from their families as they flee war or persecution, or are separated on long and dangerous journeys to safety. Between 2015 and 2019, refugee family reunion was a safe route for families to be reunited in the UK: more than 29,000 people were granted visas, 90% of which were for women and children. But more recently, the government’s immigration rules have been failing refugee children who were previously able to rely on this system to enable them to join family members.All too often, government policy is restricting refugee children from being reunited with family members. First, children outside the UK who are separated from their families are now prevented from joining refugee aunts, uncles, grandparents and adult siblings in the UK due to entry conditionsthat are extremely hard to meet, such as fees that can cost thousands of pounds.Second, separated refugee children in the UK do not have the right to bring their parents or siblings to join them under the family reunion rules. This policy leaves these children without their family, unless their loved ones attempt a dangerous journey to reach them.Furthermore, Afghans resettled in the UK from evacuations in 2021 are entirely excluded from refugee family reunion. Children were separated from their mothers and fathers during the chaos of the evacuations from Afghanistan and are still waiting, nearly three years later, for the government to open a reunion pathway for them to be able to join their parents in the UK, despite the promises made to them.Even where children may be eligible to apply for family reunion, extreme delays in the system can cause children to lose hope and attempt dangerous journeys instead. As of August 2023, two-thirds of the children the charity Safe Passage International supports who wish to reunite with family had to wait longer than the Home Office’s standard processing time of 12 weeks for an initial decision.Between January 2021 and August 2023, more than a quarter of the children Safe Passage International has been supporting became so desperate that, to the best of the charity’s knowledge, they travelled to the UK on small boats or on the back of a lorry instead. In comparison, between 2016 and 2023, of the many children Safe Passage International helped to reunite with their family under the EU’s Dublin III regulation, only one risked a dangerous journey.Ruthless people smugglers are capitalising on these policy failings and the desperation of unaccompanied children, who are particularly vulnerable to smugglers’ promises to reunite them with their families. Smugglers offer children a risky alternative, one which means they could reach their family in just a few days. As children grow more desperate, they become more and more likely to take this risk.These policy failings have other consequences beyond dangerous Channel crossings. The Refugee Council works with children in the UK whose separation from family has led to difficulties in school and a loss of interest in learning, playing and even eating, because they miss their families so much.Sunak and his cabinet think one packed Rwanda flight will save them. It won’t | Enver SolomonRead moreRefugee children are left waiting in dangerous situations, from hiding from the Taliban in exploitative conditions to sleeping homeless in northern France. Most of the children Safe Passage International works with experience depression, PTSD, anxiety and even self-harm or suicidal thoughts.The Refugee Council and Safe Passage International have published five recommendations that the government could adopt to facilitate family reunion. These include removing barriers to children joining non-parent adult relatives in the UK, and amending the rules to allow refugee children in the UK to sponsor parents and siblings.I urge the government to implement these recommendations, which we estimate could result in 1,000 additional family reunion visas, including 300 for unaccompanied children. Recent polling carried out by Safe Passage International shows that 74% of the British public agree that child refugees should have a safe way to reunite with family in the UK, so they can just focus on being children again.\n Alf Dubs is a member of the House of Lords and patron of the Refugee Council\nExplore more on these topicsRefugeesOpinionImmigration and asylumcommentShareReuse this content", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/may/15/uk-broken-refugee-policy-children-people-smugglers"},
{"headline": "Putin’s war machine reshuffle reveals his deepest fear – the rise of Kremlin rivals", "author": "Samantha de Bendern", "teaser": "By moving Sergei Shoigu and promoting key allies, Russia’s leader is shoring up the military-industrial complex that justifies his survival", "published": "Wed 15 May 2024 12.16 CEST", "content": "When the Russian defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, was removed from his post and appointed head of the security council this week, there were two big questions on everyone’s mind. What would his successor, Andrei Belousov, bring to the table, and what would happen to the former head of the security council, Nikolai Patrushev – reputed to be the second most powerful man in Russia and seen by many as a potential successor to Vladimir Putin?The second question has a straightforward answer. Patrushev, it seems, is being sidelined. Yesterday, the Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Patrushev had been appointed to the grand position of presidential aide for shipbuilding – barring any further surprise moves, this is a considerable downgrade in role.The question of what Shoigu’s removal will mean is a bit trickier, but it may also be a case of Putin neutralising an ally who has become too powerful. The Kremlin reshuffle was initially interpreted as a much-needed anti-corruption clean-up within Russia’s security apparatus. There was last month’s arrest of Shoigu’s close ally, the deputy defence minister Timur Ivanov, and the reported detention on unspecified criminal charges of Yuri Kuznetsov, another senior figure in the defence ministry this week.But the Russian political scientist Mikhail Savva insists that Shoigu’s dismissal, and the nomination of Belousov as the new defence minister, “have nothing to do with Shoigu’s corruption”, adding that “in those circles everyone steals”. This is about two things: taking back control of military spending and removing any threat to Putin’s power.Belousov is described as a trustworthy “bureaucrat among bureaucrats”, and “President Putin’s Albert Speer”, who will take Russia’s military industrial complex to a new level of efficiency. Russia’s myriad of pro-war bloggers have welcomed him as a technocratic manager who will undertake a full audit of military spending and manage the finances and procurement vital to the army, but leave military issues to the general staff.By putting an economist who strongly believes that the state should be the main driver of the economy at the head of the defence ministry, Putin is showing the world that he is turning the whole of Russia into a war machine, and that he is digging in for the long haul. For this he needs a good technocrat who is above all loyal.Indeed, unlike Shoigu, Belousov does not come with a power base or a clan of loyal followers. He owes his position to Putin, is an introvert who does not seek the limelight and most importantly does not threaten to build a parallel power base to Putin. Vladimir Osechkin, an exiled political commentator with close ties to the security apparatus, explains that Putin is terrified of a repeat of last June’s events, when Yevgeny Prigozhin led a mutinous rebellion.So, if it seems strange to dismiss the minister of defence while things are picking up on the front, it is precisely because of that success that Putin can now move Shoigu aside. According to Ivan Preobrazhensky, a Russian political commentator and member of the Free Russia Forum, “Putin was afraid of changing the top brass in the defence ministry while the front was unstable”.All of this points to Putin’s fear of the power struggles inside the Kremlin and the awareness that, as he builds his absolutist power, there are cracks that could widen unless he takes pre-emptive measures. In this context, it is interesting to look at some of the other appointments of the last few days.While Patrushev has been given the unenviable task of supervising the building of ships to replace those that have been destroyed by Ukrainian drones, his son Dmitry has been promoted from agriculture minister to deputy prime minister in charge of agriculture. Another dynastic positioning also took place at the weekend when Putin nominated Boris Kovalchuk, the son of his closest adviser and main financier Yuri Kovalchuk, to be head of Russia’s audit chamber.By placing the children of his close advisers in prominent positions, Putin shows he is playing for the long haul, and making every effort to secure his future and that of his closest allies. He is signalling to them that they are safe for now, but by tying the next generation of leaders to his political survival he is clipping the wings of any potential threat in a carefully crafted balancing act.Mark Galeotti, the director of Mayak Intelligence and a historian specialising in Russia, explains that Shoigu is unlikely to inherit much power in his new post at the security council. Patrushev was seen as highly influential in that role, but this is derived partly from his personality, as well as his past as an old Putin confidant in St Petersburg, and as former head of the FSB.In his new position, Shoigu will also oversee the federal service for military-technical cooperation. Between this, and Patrushev as shipbuilding aide, the nominal heads of some of the most corrupt sectors of the Russian economy are both controlled by Putin. Putin has effectively just put the whole military industrial complex under presidential control, thereby boosting his personal power by taking over the whole of the war economy and the opportunities for corruption that go with it.In the short term this makes Putin seem even more impregnable and underlines the fact that he is not interested in any kind of peace that would put a stop to the war, which feeds his power, political and material. It also shows how wary he is of political challengers, and leaves him very vulnerable should the war not go his way. In the medium and long term, this will spell disaster for the Russian economy, as the war drains resources and human power into a cycle of production whose only aim is to feed the war.Those who think that Putin would be open to negotiating over a piece of eastern Ukraine and Crimea should bear this in mind when hoping for a quick negotiated end to this war.

It was only as I reached my mid-40s that I realised that might never happen.In reality, I’m a lot more like the characters in the European arthouse films I like to watch (on my own) than the Hollywood fare I grew up on. When I see family and friends post pictures of baby showers, hen parties and birthday celebrations, I wonder why my own camera reel looks so radically different. Scroll through my social media and you will find shots of speciality coffee, documentaries about human rights abuses and the auditoriums of old theatres.For decades, I tried making my interests social, in the pursuit of finding my tribe. I organised group theatre trips, coffee dates and baby cinema with women I sort of got along with, but lasting bonds just didn’t form. I wasted hours fretting about my inability to be irreverent, until I realised it simply isn’t in me. I’m not the person who will turn up on your doorstep with ice-cream when you break up with your loser boyfriend – I’m probably the person who told you to leave him six months ago.I had always struggled to find my people. In my 20s, I made several attempts at friendship with the other women on my floor in my semi-corporate workplace. But when it came to Friday drinks, they didn’t invite me. Was my water-cooler chat dull? Had I been watching Big Brother for nothing? I didn’t understand their aloofness, but later found out it was because they didn’t like the way that I dressed.Another office full of women yielded slightly more promising results when they invited me along to a Kylie Minogue concert. Unfortunately, our girl group disbanded when I was promoted at work. Kylie was a harbinger of sorts: solo careers sustain (Beyoncé, Madonna) while ambition in girl groups can trigger a split (Sugababes, Destiny’s Child).In my 30s, it was mum groups – pregnancy yoga, baby sensory and the group WhatsApp. Surely all that oxytocin and sleep deprivation would bond me to some other women? I did plenty of downward dog, but, ultimately, I just didn’t click with anyone. Aside from complaining about not eating sushi or blue cheese for nine months, we didn’t have much to say to each other.Now that I’m in my 40s, with two children under the age of five, a part-time PhD and a to-read pile that might crush me if I don’t make a start on it, I really can’t be bothered to waste any more time trying to fit a mould that was made for others. I’m done enthusiastically replying to WhatsApp messages with hearts or smiley faces in an effort to spark a friendship. I’d much rather sit solo with a quality cuppa, or wander around an art gallery on my own.Still, not having that group of women to laugh and cry with has made me feel I am missing out over the years. Maybe I couldn’t find them because I’m not fun enough? Maybe I’m not worth investing in – too weird, or worse yet, boring. Invasive thoughts like these hit us all, but I can’t offload them to my girlfriends, or drown them out with Friday night drinks and dancing or group hugs. Instead, I sit with myself, often surrounded by silence. And I write. Sometimes it is lonely, but ultimately, I’m OK with that.\n Tara Judah is a film critic and writer\n Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

{"headline": "The Guardian view on protecting Sudan’s civilians: there is no more time to be lost", "author": "Editorial", "teaser": "A year after the war began, the world’s largest humanitarian catastrophe is deepening", "published": "Wed 15 May 2024 20.03 CEST", "content": "There are three ways that civilians can die in the war closing in on El Fasher, the only major city in Sudan’s Darfur region yet to be taken by the Rapid Support Forces, and they are already dying in two of them. The first is deprivation: the blockade of humanitarian aid has intensified already desperate circumstances. The second is crossfire. Two children and at least one caregiver were killed when an airstrike by the Sudanese armed forces hit close to a paediatric hospital at the weekend, according to Médecins Sans Frontières.The third, warns Nathaniel Raymond, executive director of Yale University’s Humanitarian Research Laboratory, is targeted mass killing. More than 1.5 million people are in the city, many having fled fighting elsewhere. The Raoul Wallenberg Centre for Human Rights has concluded that genocide is occurring in Darfur again – only two decades after it horrified the world. Human Rights Watch said last week that crimes against humanity were committed by the RSF and allied militias against the ethnic Masalit and other non-Arab populations in and around El Geneina last year, with thousands dying. The British government has said the violence displayed “all the hallmarks of ethnic cleansing”. There is every reason to fear that El Fasher will see more.The suffering wreaked upon Sudan in just over a year of war is terrifying. The army chief Gen Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and Lt Gen Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo – known as “Hemedti” – of the RSF paramilitaries turned upon each other last April. The direst predictions made then are coming true. At least 14,700 people have died. Almost 25 million people – more than half the population – need aid. More than 8 million people are displaced. Both sides have committed war crimes.The RSF’s record is grim and well-documented and they have already razed villages around El Fasher. The SAF have also escalated matters. Analysts suspect they see the fight – which they have mostly subcontracted to local allies – as tying down the RSF and damaging them politically.Outside parties have fuelled this civil war. The United Arab Emirates has backed the RSF, and Iran and Egypt supported Gen Burhan; Russia appears to be trying to play both sides. Yet there are signs that the UAE may belatedly be recognising the reputational costs as diplomatic efforts ramp up.The UK has a special responsibility, given that it leads on Sudan at the security council. Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the US ambassador to the UN, has warned that an attack on El Fasher would be a “large-scale massacre … a disaster on top of a disaster” and threatened consequences if it goes ahead. The US, UK and others have imposed sanctions on entities linked to the RSF and the SAF.Pressure at all levels – from the UN security council to regional governments engaging with lower level commanders – is needed to restore the informal truce in place around El Fasher late last year. The SAF must also be pressed to commit to serious negotiations on a ceasefire and an end to the war, despite Gen Burhan’s unrealistic assessment of his position. NGOs and Sudanese activists are right to call for an arms embargo on Sudan as a whole and a new UN mission to protect civilians, though a more plausible first step might be an agreement for third-party monitors in El Fasher. The world’s largest humanitarian crisis has unfolded to widespread indifference and cynicism. That cannot continue.

{"headline": "My fellow citizens – we share confined spaces, but do I have to overhear your chat, your music, your TikTok?", "author": "Zoe Williams", "teaser": "With telephone signal now more available on the London underground, it’s time for a new etiquette about how we co-exist ", "published": "Wed 15 May 2024 09.00 CEST", "content": "Phone signal went live this week across a quarter of the underground system in the capital, mainly in central London, with further coverage planned by the end of summer. This is great news for people who can’t go five minutes without talking, and bad news for everyone else. The previous lack of network coverage was just about the only thing keeping us civil.Across all transport networks, there has been a radical divergence in etiquette since the pandemic. That period, when there was minimal occasion to share space with strangers, introduced a lot of complexity to a system that was already badly codified, and somehow erased all the tacit consensus we’d reached beforehand.The rules used to be incredibly simple: if you wanted to listen to anything on public transport, you did it with headphones. The only grey areas were around “is anything audible through the headphones?” (ideally not, but a young person with the volume up in a surfeit of joie de vivre could get away with it), and “should an audible conversation be held with a real-life associate?”. Friends and couples normally stay pretty quiet, but colleagues find it impossible because of the power imbalance: silence is awkward unless it’s mutually agreed, but only two equals can make that pact. It’s insane, the amount of “continuous professional development” you can eavesdrop on public transport, set against the vanishing rarity of hearing a couple even discuss what they want for dinner.But after Covid, the brakes came off. It’s now no longer unusual to hear music, TikToks, whole TV shows sometimes, broadcast to the carriage, as if the phone and its owner are in a private world and everyone else is just a simulation. Some bystanders seem merely annoyed by this, but for others it is hell, since they can’t tackle the original rule breach without, themselves, breaching an older rule – never engage with a stranger on the tube. I once, unknowingly, sat next to my actual dad on the Piccadilly line, thinking: “Weird, that person smells like my dad”, and still didn’t look directly at him until we were getting off. At the same stop. Because we were meeting each other.Masking, too, has become another flashpoint: after face masks ceased to be mandatory, plenty of people still chose to wear one and became the focus of silent ire for those who disagreed with … well, it was never clear exactly what they were disagreeing with. To some, masks were an affront to civil liberties, to others they were an excess of caution and, by extension, a statement of distrust in others. The disapproval is mirrored by the maskers, who still – though they are few – vent a powerful silent disapprobation in a busy carriage. Or is that just what faces look like when all you can see is the eyes?If etiquette on the internet is still the wild west – the territory simply expanding and changing too fast for social regulation to evolve on its own – transport manners are in more of a postwar/ post-natural disaster state: we all remember what they used to be. But some people would prefer not to go back to the old ways.Into all this has stepped the etiquette expert William Hanson, who did so much of the legwork building new rules during the pandemic. His tube edicts in full: eat nothing smellier than a mint; in a full carriage, maintain glacial silence (a Fox’s Glacial silence, if you like); in an emptier one, quiet chat is permitted; all music and calls on headphones; and finally, a huge amount of choreography around backpacks.All good, but quite millennial – notice the entire absence of whether or not you can do your makeup on the tube, which the bracketing generations (X and Z) are obsessed with. When I was growing up, the rule was that you could do anything cosmetic so long as it didn’t produce waste (mascara, fine; tweezing out a chin hair, absolutely no way). Gen Z takes that as a given, but having grown up with Zoella and the makeup tutorial, they reserve the right to watch closely and judge, noiselessly.As for the phone calls with headphones, available for the first time in the tube’s 150-ish year history, you’re left with the fact that you are still talking. This breaches about half of all the rules at once – noise pollution, oversharing and, depending on what you’re saying, producing waste – and the facility should be exercised with caution.Having said that, millennials would never answer or make a call that hadn’t been scheduled; a quarter of gen Z have never answered their phones at all; boomers can’t hear over the ambient carriage sounds; and gen X – well, who’re we gonna call?

{"headline": "Can the civil service survive the chaos and incompetence of Team Sunak? Of course we can: we’re optimists", "author": "The civil servant", "teaser": "As this difficult era nears its endgame, we are guided by a belief in good governance – and buoyed up by public support", "published": "Wed 15 May 2024 11.00 CEST", "content": "The end-of-season finale is almost here. As the country slides inexorably and eagerly down the greased abattoir chute towards the end of what might be the worst-ever parliamentary session, you might ask if civil servants have become paralysed – either by chronic depression or pathological levels of schadenfreude – due to the spectacle of our leaders’ insistence on prioritising political theatre, the now-doomed Rwanda policy and the war on “diversity and inclusion” over doing the actual day job.The short answer: it’ll take more than that. Yes, civil service staff turnover is worryingly high, and morale has been declining fast. We’ve been persistently attacked for being “remoaning” obstructionists, “activist” saboteurs and Brexit crybabies. We’ve been castigated for showing that working from home actually works, and for daring to raise questions about the legality of arms sales to Israel. This month, we’ve even – for the first time – had to mount a legal challenge over the constitutional jeopardy that ministers have put civil servants in by ramming through their unworkable Rwanda scheme. Last but not least, we’ve had to weather another virtuosic blizzard of “common sense” from Esther McVey about banning “diversity and inclusion” jobs. McVey doesn’t seem to realise that listening to the Tory party sermonise about the perils of diversity and inclusion has the same level of credibility as Dr Crippen giving a Ted talk.But the longer answer is that despite all of the above – and maybe partly because of it – civil servants are idealists. Adherents. A 500,000-strong (and growing – thanks Rishi!) army of believers with absurdly high, perhaps comically high levels of optimism.I’ll concede that the civil service has a reputation for cultivating lots of workplace “churn”, and that many of us (according to the Institute for Government) are leaving for greener pastures elsewhere. But on the whole, civil servants tend to stay for years – certainly for far longer than some of the current crop of ministers, who struggle to last more than eight months. You can argue the toss about whether we are any more effective, but the vast majority of us believe in what we are doing, and tend to stick around in the hope that things can get better.Where does that optimism come from? Tradition and practice. For the battered (but still functioning) machinery of government to get anything done, from pensions and passports to public health, we have to show – not just by inclination, but also by law – that we believe in three fundamental principles that it suits some ministers to pretend to consider quaint.First, civil servants believe that facts matter and that we all share the same reality – we don’t really go in for magical thinking. Second, we believe in fairness, and that what works in Guildford should also work in Gateshead and Glasgow. And we believe in the principle of moral equivalence: that if it’s wrong for you to do something, it’s wrong for us, too.Not exactly the Sermon on the Mount, eh? Yet this stuff underpins the not-yet-dead Nolan principles of public life, the civil service code and every recommendation that we present to ministers, who may or may not decide to implement them. But we don’t take the decisions lightly. Recent polling suggests that the disintegrating quality and integrity of this government’s decision-making is precisely what is driving it toward electoral oblivion.In the meantime, what really helps us keep going is knowing that the British public are with us. According to a poll last year, they think civil servants are far more trustworthy and hard-working than government ministers. Of course they do. According to recent Cabinet Office figures, the average civil servant is more likely to be female, is 44 years old, earns slightly more than £30,000 a year and is overwhelmingly likely to live outside London. Not exactly deep-state wokerati sleeper agents. They’re just normal people doing normal jobs, not in the gilded drawing rooms and private offices of Whitehall but in the call centres and service hubs of Darlington, East Kilbride and Cardiff.Let’s stop talking about ‘great’ Britain – and rebrand ourselves as a different sort of country | Martin KettleRead moreWeirdly, the further away from London we are, the happier we seem to be: a survey by the Institute for Government on how the civil service is changing showed that turnover is highest at the heart of government, at 26.2% in the Treasury and 23.7% in the Cabinet Office. Turnover was lowest in the Welsh and Scottish governments, at 4.7% and 6% respectively.It’s not hard to guess why. Taking a look north may provide clues: Scottish government civil servants (who report to Scottish ministers rather than UK ones) are the sixth largest department of the UK civil service and – according to friends and colleagues who work there – enjoy a far less hostile environment.Oh, and they also happen to have recently won the right to knock off early on a Friday, were the first UK civil servants to win the right to not be contacted outside office hours, and have been trialling a four-day work week. And while there were reports earlier this year that the ruling SNP party has “captured” Holyrood civil servants, the mood music of the first few days of John Swinney’s new tenure as first minister suggest he’s far less likely than his Westminster cousins to insult, harangue and undermine the civil servants on whom public services depend.To ministers in Sunak’s England, we say, look to Scotland – look and learn.\n The author works for the UK civil service\nExplore more on these topicsCivil serviceOpinionScottish politicscommentShareReuse this content", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/may/15/civil-service-rishi-sunak-public-support"},
{"headline": "The Guardian view on asylum and Northern Ireland: Rishi Sunak has sabotaged his own legacy", "author": "Editorial", "teaser": "A Belfast court ruling exposes quite how far the prime minister has wandered from the pragmatic governing ethos he once espoused", "published": "Wed 15 May 2024 20.04 CEST", "content": "The Windsor framework was Rishi Sunak’s first significant achievement as prime minister and will probably turn out to be the last. A deal to settle problems with the way that Boris Johnson’s Brexit withdrawal agreement applied to Northern Ireland was achieved by rejecting the former prime minister’s maverick, confrontational approach and embracing instead an ethos of diplomatic pragmatism.But no sooner had Mr Sunak demonstrated the merit in honouring international treaties than he abandoned that method with regard to immigration policy. His pledge to “stop the boats” ferrying refugees across the Channel produced acts of parliament that defy the European convention on human rights, which happens also to be integral to the Good Friday agreement underpinning peace in Northern Ireland.A migration policy flimsily conceived from a simple slogan, and from which the prime minister has made no political gain, is at odds with the one act of serious statecraft for which he might deserve some credit. The contradiction was brought into stark relief this week when a Belfast court ruled that sections of the 2023 Illegal Migration Act should not apply in Northern Ireland.A principal function of the act is to remove any prospect of a successful asylum claim from the vast majority of people who arrive by “irregular” means. With a few very narrowly defined exceptions, any refugee who crosses the Channel in a small boat is disqualified from ever settling in the UK. This is meant to be a disincentive to making the journey, and a precursor to deportation to Rwanda.The high court ruled this arrangement to be a form of discrimination and a breach of human rights guarantees that – even if withdrawn in Britain – are still extended to everyone in Northern Ireland under the Good Friday agreement, by way of the Brexit withdrawal agreement and the Windsor framework.That is a cluster headache for Mr Sunak. It turns Northern Ireland into a potential zone of sanctuary for anyone who might be eligible for deportation to Rwanda. It implies good prospects for success of a legal challenge to the recently passed Rwanda Safety Act, since that law is auxiliary to the Illegal Migration Act and builds on the same human rights violations. And it confirms fears among Northern Ireland unionists that Brexit arrangements create a jurisdictional border in the Irish Sea, despite Downing Street assurances that no such schism would be felt.Ministers were warned of exactly this scenario unfolding. Those concerns were brushed aside with the combination of arrogance and irresponsibility that is a trademark of the current government.Now Mr Sunak says the Belfast ruling will be appealed and, in the meantime, deportations to Rwanda from Britain can go ahead as planned. That might technically be true, but the prime minister’s ambition to declare decisive victory over small boat crossings and advertise that triumph as evidence of governing competence in an election campaign have suffered yet another blow. It was never a plausible aim, because a policy that prioritised gestural defiance of international norms over legal practicality was ill-conceived from the start.That is something Mr Sunak appeared to understand when he negotiated the Windsor framework. In choosing to forget that lesson, he has damaged Britain’s reputation as a country that abides by international law, and has squandered what prospects he had of a legacy worth remembering.Explore more on these topicsRishi SunakOpinionNorthern IrelandGood Friday agreementMigrationBrexitConservativesRefugeeseditorialsShareReuse this content", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/may/15/the-guardian-view-on-asylum-and-northern-ireland-rishi-sunak-has-sabotaged-his-own-legacy"},
{"headline": "Why are some critics vexed by Top Boy’s Baftas? Because it’s the Britain they don’t want to talk about", "author": "Franklyn Addo", "teaser": "I live and work in communities at the heart of the series, and I value its art more than Happy Valley or The Crown", "published": "Mon 13 May 2024 17.45 CEST", "content": "Last night, to the apparent dismay of some, the hit TV show Top Boy won the coveted Bafta award for best drama series. This was not supposed to happen. There was huge expectation that shows depicting a mainstream (read: white) version of life, such as Succession, The Crown and Happy Valley would sweep up.The grumbling was immediate. “The Baftas were more self-congratulation by a TV class obsessed with race, identity and bleakness,” read a headline in the Daily Telegraph. Oh, God. “Top Boy is a great series,” the piece continues, “But, as ever, there’s something dizzying about high-end TV people and their peculiar obsession with the opposite corner of society. It’s all dressed up with social conscience and concern, but there’s a whiff of ‘slumming it’.” Based on a fictional Hackney housing estate called Summerhouse, Top Boy unflinchingly confronts grim, urgent social issues. While shows such as The Crown depict the power and opulence of the British monarchy, Top Boy offers a starkly different perspective on the nation, chronicling harsh realities of poverty, drug dealing and violence on our cities’ streets – and it appears that not everyone is happy about that.As unlikely and contentious as it may be for a show like Top Boy to have come out on top at the Baftas, its success should not surprise anyone. It certainly hasn’t surprised me. It’s not just that Top Boy is gripping TV, dynamically soundtracked by Black British music, and providing crucial representation for young people from Black and diverse ethnic backgrounds. It’s also grippingly true to life – so true, in fact, that in my work as a youth violence intervention practitioner, I’ve used excerpts from the show in my sessions in schools and prisons to prompt discussion. We’ve examined moments where vans and Swat teams swamp estates as entryways to conversations about over-policing, and depictions of queerness in the show to discuss societal expectations around gender and sexuality.View image in fullscreenJasmine Jobson receiving the Bafta for best supporting actress, for her depiction of Jaq in Top Boy. Photograph: Hollie Adams/ReutersTop Boy has provided crucial representation for young Black Britons like myself. The series is raw in its approach, real (as far as TV goes), and has proved relatable to those of us from inner-city environments of deprivation with experiences of crime. Where discourse around housing estates was once fuelled by problematic programmes such as Little Britain, Top Boy offers a more nuanced, humanising insight into working-class lives, which too often have been offensively caricatured. While London’s Hackney is known today as a trendy neighbourhood with cute coffee shops and pricey properties, Top Boy explores the hardships faced by the socially marginalised and economically underprivileged and examines the context within which difficult choices are made.Top Boy is the real deal | Franklyn AddoRead moreAlthough there have been some criticisms about the overuse of slang in its script that make it verge on inauthenticity, its scripting and casting have also been top notch. In a standout acting debut, Kane Robinson (AKA celebrated British rapper Kano) delivers a stellar performance, embodying the troubled character Sully, who struggles in a battle between ego and self doubt. The lasting, multidisciplinary careers of its cast have paved the way for a new generation of talent: Little Simz and Dave, for example, have both had supporting roles in Top Boy.And its characters are complex – take Jaq, portrayed by Jasmine Jobson, who picked up the Bafta for best supporting actress. Her character subverts stereotypes and demonstrates the different experiences of women involved in or affected by street crime. In dramas that follow what it is like to be Black and working class, it certainly wasn’t the easy narrative choice. In my own work, I’ve observed how the struggles of young women are often eclipsed as we obsessively worry about boys.The reception to Top Boy was lukewarm when it first came out in 2011, as some commentators thought it was just another drama glorifying guns. I wrote then that this amounted to little more than hysteria around a show that realistically depicts what life is like for some people in Britain, calling Top Boy “the real deal”. That is still true today – and if commentators can’t see that, it says more about them than it does about the show.\n Franklyn Addo is a youth worker, journalist and rapper from Hackney, London\nDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

{"headline": "The 1.5C global heating target was always a dream, but its demise doesn’t signal doom for climate action", "author": "Bill McKibben", "teaser": "Missing a target doesn’t mean the sense of emergency should fade. What it must do is stop politicians dithering – and fast", "published": "Wed 15 May 2024 14.06 CEST", "content": "I remember the first time I heard the 1.5C target. It was in a room at the Copenhagen climate talks in 2009. With the expectation of a binding agreement slipping away and negotiations failing, some of us activists joined delegates from vulnerable African and island nations in chanting “1.5 to stay alive”. It was a frank recognition that the 2C goal the climate diplomats were endlessly talking about – though not pursuing – was insufficient to deal with the increasingly clear realities of climate science.Since then, three things have happened.One, the global community more or less pledged to aim for that 1.5C target, in the preamble to the 2015 Paris climate accords. It was largely an effort to appease the small island states, added at the last minute. At the time, it wasn’t clear what a big impact it would have.Two, quite to the surprise of the negotiators who stuck it in, it became the central result of the Paris talks. This new target made the crisis seem almost as urgent as it really is: instead of talking about 2050, scientists made it clear we’d have to cut emissions in half by 2030 to have a chance of meeting the new goal. All of a sudden companies and countries were being forced to at least articulate 1.5-compliant goals: nothing has turned up the dial on climate action like this number.Three, despite the increased pressure, and a target that was widely communicated and understood, we didn’t act fast enough. The pandemic came at just the wrong moment, knocking the climate movement out of the streets and giving the fossil-fuel industry time to recover its footing; leadership of critical states during what you could call the Trump, Putin, Bolsonaro and Modi years killed some of the Paris momentum; and only now are we beginning to install solar, wind and batteries at anything like the required pace.So now we’ve gone past the 1.5C mark for at least a year, and as the recent Guardian survey of climate scientists makes clear, almost none of them think we will stay below that number long term.All of which is to say, the target was very useful, and at the same time we’re not going to meet it. But the odds have always been we wouldn’t; striving to do so was like trying to slam on the brakes. We didn’t mash the pedal fast enough, and so we’re going to have an accident – indeed, we are having them all the time in the form of increasing climate-fuelled disasters. But thanks to the goal those activists set, we at least reduced our speed somewhat.How bad things will get depends on the actions not of scientists, but on those who control our governments and economies, and on those of us who can push them. The researchers in the Guardian survey were mostly bleak: we’re likely to end up at 3C, many of them said. But it’s important to read their words carefully. For instance, Ruth Cerezo-Mota, a Mexican climate modeller, said: “I think 3C is being hopeful and conservative. 1.5C is already bad, but I don’t think there is any way we are going to stick to that. There is not any clear sign from any government that we are actually going to stay under 1.5C.”Her prediction rests not on climate science but on political science. She is entirely correct that governments are not making the right moves yet, and there’s good reason to fear they won’t. But of course that’s not inevitable – unlike physics, politics is at least theoretically malleable. If scientists could control the outcome, we’d be fine, but they probably aren’t the best people to ask about what’s going to happen politically: that’s like polling dietitians to find out how much I’ll weigh in a decade.Truth be told, the chances of politicians acting swiftly are probably better than they have been in the past. Not because of new scientific findings, but because solar, wind and batteries have become so cheap so fast that the amount of pain involved in the transition to clean energy is far less than it would have been a decade ago. We could actually do this.The remaining political pain is what politicians would suffer from standing up to an increasingly desperate fossil-fuel industry – the CEOs, say, who met with Donald Trump last month, to plot how they might together take down Joe Biden. So the job of activists is to make sure that there’s at least as much pain for politicians if they take that route – and real reward if they do the right thing.The precise number we’re aiming for matters less at this point than the time frame: what 1.5C taught the policymakers was that they can’t do their usual dithering. This is an emergency – and the sense of emergency hasn’t faded with the passing of a target.The news from the atmosphere and the ocean is very, very grim. The news from the engineers is promising. We don’t yet know how it will play out, just that we still have some power to decide. But only – and this is the most important message the scientists have to offer – if we act with great speed. If we don’t, the deal is done.\n Bill McKibben is the founder of Third Act, which organizes people over 60 for action on climate and democracy\nExplore more on these topicsClimate crisisOpinionClimate scienceFossil fuelscommentShareReuse this content", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/may/15/1-5-degree-global-heating-target-climate-action"},

Finally, he’s here", "author": "Alexander Hurst", "teaser": "The June European elections are my first as a French citizen – and they’re in time to vote for the rising star of the left, Raphaël Glucksmann", "published": "Fri 10 May 2024 13.00 CEST", "content": "Maybe it’s the result of having moved to Europe with a North American point of view, but it has always stunned me that Europe’s nations – crammed together into an elbow of a landmass – could ever think of their sort as anything but inextricably linked. Regardless of what river, mountain range or narrow channel of water their borders run along, anything but a united Europe will be a plaything in a world split between the unchallenged economic power of the US and China.Emmanuel Macron understands this. It’s why he’s often at his most prescient and convincing when he talks about Europe. As far as a vision for Europe goes, the first speech he gave at the Sorbonne won me over in 2017; when he returned in late April this year for Europe Speech 2.0, I once again found myself agreeing with his calls for greater European federalism. But in the 9 June European elections, in which I have a vote – my first ever as a French and European citizen – I’m not sure that I’ll vote for the French president’s party, Renaissance. First, because I’m not sure that Macron, the object of so much domestic division, is well-placed to bring France along with him for all the ways that Europe urgently needs to evolve. And second, because France desperately needs a left wing that is genuinely committed to the European project. The 9 June poll is a chance for that French left to reassert itself (to “take back control”, if you will) by regrouping behind Raphaël Glucksmann.At 44, two years younger than Macron, Glucksmann has made his mark as an MEP by being vocal about the need for European integration as essential to accelerating the green transition, promoting human rights globally and solidifying democracy against authoritarianism. To his credit, support for these things goes deeper than his career in electoral politics. As a young journalist, Glucksmann made a 2004 documentary, Tuez-les tous!, about France’s role in the Rwandan genocide, and he was in Kyiv for the 2013 Euromaidan protests. Perhaps his long experience with Ukraine is why Glucksmann has always been clear-eyed about the danger Vladimir Putin poses to Europe as a whole. And in the context of rising illiberalism across the political spectrum, he has cut ties with the far-left firebrand Jean-Luc Mélenchon. The downside of what Macron accomplished in 2017 and held together in 2022 –uniting the mainstream left and right under the banner of radical centrism – is that it has reinforced the horseshoe theory of politics fuelling an even more radical opposition on the far left and far right. (It certainly didn’t help that after his 2017 election, Macron quickly and repeatedly stepped into an easy caricature of himself as arrogant and lacking empathy.) No country can long sustain a politics that has become extractive, where a significant chunk of its political class seeks destruction in the hopes of one day ruling over the rubble. In the US, one half plays this game unilaterally against the other half; in France, both poles of the horseshoe have played it against the centre. We know what the far-right vision for Europe is: hostility to immigrants, a lack of green investment and regulation, open season for illiberal leaders to erode the rule of law, judicial independence and a free press, and a far more friendly turn towards the Kremlin. By retreating behind the useful youth of 28-year-old Jordan Bardella, Marine Le Pen has achieved ever-increasing normalisation for the National Rally, which now leads pre-election polls with 32% of the vote. And the far left, under Mélenchon’s leadership, has spent the past two years helping to do her job. The French are more afraid of seeing Mélenchon in power than they are Le Pen.Mélenchon has cast a solid left-Eurosceptic shadow over French politics. Glucksmann has a chance to change that by convincingly marking the argument that many of the left’s priorities – a wealth tax, public contracting with local producers, reorganising subsidies to farmers around regenerative agriculture, protecting strict climate regulations, massive green investment in everything from renewables to affordable train travel – only make real sense at a European level.With 14% of French voters supporting Glucksmann’s party, Place Publique, there is a significant portion of the French electorate that doesn’t fully align with Macron domestically, but that wants none of the Euroscepticism Mélenchon is offering, and that has come to Glucksmann from both Macron’s camp (on 17% support) and Mélenchon’s (on 7%). These voters understand that in the face of behemoth economies like China and the US, and unflinching aggression from Putin, sovereignty is nothing if not European. They desire greater integration in order to have real impact on the climate crisis and ecology, and they know that Europe’s strongest global lever of influence on behalf of both is access – or not – to its single market. Elections often involve some amount of tug-of-war between a strategic vote and a heartfelt one. But on 9 June, for the first time since the very first vote I ever cast (for Barack Obama, in 2008), my vote for Raphaël Glucksmann will be both a vote of strategy and a vote de coeur.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to This is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

{"headline": "The Guardian view on health spending: a broken promise that voters are unlikely to forget or forgive", "author": "Editorial", "teaser": "The Tories’ record in office undermines their claim at the last election to be the party of the NHS", "published": "Tue 14 May 2024 20.11 CEST", "content": "In 2010, the Commons health select committee warned the new Conservative-led government that the NHS in England was facing cuts rather than the promised real-terms increases. The message could not be easily dismissed, as the committee was then chaired by a former Tory cabinet minister. Now, eight health secretaries later, plus ça change, plus c’est la même chose. The Institute for Fiscal Studies said this week that day-to-day NHS spending had grown by 2.7% a year during the current parliament, well short of the 3.3% annual increases pledged by Boris Johnson in 2019.The Tories claimed at the last election to be the party of the NHS, seeking to capitalise on Brexit’s unfounded claim to be good for the health service. Voters don’t buy that today. Long waiting lists at hospitals for elective operations and frustration over the lack of access to GPs have led to public satisfaction with the health service plummeting to an all-time low. An estimated 250 patients are dying unnecessarily every week in England because of the queues for emergency care. Both the government and NHS England blame industrial action for waiting lists not falling fast enough. But, as the Nuffield Trust health thinktank pointed out last year, it is “unlikely that the lost activity would have been enough to enable waiting lists to come down”.It is true that the pandemic and cost of living shock have not made life easy for ministers. But there has been resistance in Conservative ranks to viewing the NHS as a national investment that improves societal wellbeing, protects people from the financial consequences of illness, reduces health inequalities and supports economic growth. Rather, it is seen by many Tories as a drain on the public purse.From 2010/11 to 2019/20, the average funding increase for the health service was less than 2%, which led to a shortfall of about £30bn in its annual budget, compared with what would have been expected if the NHS had received the historical rate of spending that allowed it to keep pace with long-term pressures from demography, medical advances and rising patient expectations. The result was that the number of patients who had been referred to hospital but were still waiting for treatment doubled from 2.3m in January 2010 to 4.6m in December 2019.Covid-19 only made things worse – the overall waiting list for routine treatments stood at 7.54m in February. Sufficient funding has not materialised to deal with the backlog. Demand for private healthcare has soared, leading to concerns of a two-tier system. Sir Keir Starmer says his party will get the health service “back on its feet”. This may be costly. Labour has signed up to the government’s NHS workforce plan, which implies annual budget increases of 3.6% a year in real terms. In Sir Keir’s defence, he might say that this is a long-term ambition. However, the Labour leader might not want to leave it too long. A winter flu crisis and rising public anger forced Tony Blair’s hand over NHS spending in 2000. Surely it would be better for Sir Keir to be ahead of the curve than behind it.Explore more on these topicsNHSOpinionHealthPublic services policyHealth policyConservativesKeir StarmerLaboureditorialsShareReuse this content", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/may/14/the-guardian-view-on-health-spending-a-broken-promise-that-voters-are-unlikely-to-forget-or-forgive"},
{"headline": "Our Post Office victory is being twisted by those who don’t want to see its like again", "author": "Alan Bates", "teaser": "Litigation funders didn’t ‘exploit’ subpostmasters, they helped us. Those who attack them have corporate interests at heart", "published": "Fri 10 May 2024 09.00 CEST", "content": "You are probably familiar with the case Alan Bates and Others v Post Office Ltd. The high court found that I and 554 other former subpostmasters were right about the Post Office’s faulty Horizon IT system. What you might not know, however, is that this case would not have been possible without something called litigation funding.This is when a third party provides the money for a legal battle in return for a share of the damages or settlement in the case of a victory. The arrangement worked very well for us. In fact, there would have been no justice for subpostmasters without it, given the exorbitant costs of the legal system in England and Wales. But there is now a concerted effort by big business to constrain access to litigation funding.First, the good news. Recent new laws have been introduced to ensure cases like ours can continue to be financed by litigation funding. At the same time, a review into the sector is under way to ensure civil justice is “more accessible, fair and efficient”. However, elsewhere I’ve been reading claims that the subpostmasters were, in fact, “exploited” – and that the funders who bankrolled our case “hijacked the spoils” of the settlement. It has also been claimed that funders “severely limited the justice achieved”. Based on our experience, those claims are absolute nonsense.It seems to be nonsense promoted by an outfit calling itself “Fair Civil Justice”, affiliated to the US Chamber of Commerce, an organisation that represents the interests of big business. It also seems that corporate interests have tried to paint us as the victims of a “secret financing” deal. Again, not true. We knew exactly what we were entering into; it was the only option we had left to expose the truth that the Post Office were determined to keep from us.The terms of the deal were clearly explained by our lawyers. Our funders, the litigation financing firm Therium, extended our credit on a number of occasions when the Post Office cynically drove up our legal costs. Therium, and our legal teams, even took a haircut on their returns to ensure the victims group received some return as they went on to pursue the truth through further court cases, enabling convictions to be overturned and real financial redress to be sought.If the Horizon scandal has taught us anything about our legal system, it’s that it is skewed in favour of those with deep pockets. Large corporations can exhaust their opponents’ reserves – both in terms of finances and resilience. A prime piece of evidence for this is an internal Post Office memo, released as part of the current statutory inquiry into the Post Office, which only came about as a result of the findings of our original case. It is from Post Office lawyers pledging to: “stretch out the litigation process so to increase costs in the hope that the claimants, and more particularly their litigation funder, decide that it is too costly to pursue the litigation and give up”.Critics of the litigation sector have also argued for caps on funders’ fees. But that simply wouldn’t work. In our case, it would have just provided a target for the Post Office to aim for to achieve its stated goal of forcing us to “give up”. There have to be ways of discouraging these appalling legal tactics, not encouraging them.It should be defendants who have to pay the legal bills of successful claimants – that would certainly make them think twice about cynically dragging a case out. It would save time for the courts, reduce suffering for claimants, and it would ultimately save money for all.Without litigation funding, what has been called the “greatest miscarriage of justice in British legal history” would not have been exposed. We would never have got to the truth, or been able to open the door to obtain the financial redress the victims are rightfully owed. As Lord Arbuthnot, a great champion and supporter of our cause, put it recently: funders helped us in “blowing the bloody doors off”.Constraining funders by effectively reducing the number of cases they can take on might serve large corporations with something to hide. But it certainly would not be in the interests of claimants. That’s not to say there aren’t ways of making civil justice “more accessible, fair and efficient”. Of course there are. I just hope the review puts claimants’ experiences and interests front and centre of its work to ensure that access to justice is enhanced, not narrowed even further.\n Alan Bates is a former subpostmaster and the founder of the Justice for Subpostmasters Alliance\n Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

{"headline": "The Guardian view on Russia’s new offensive: Ukraine’s allies must renew their focus", "author": "Editorial", "teaser": "Significant advances by Vladimir Putin’s forces in the Kharkiv region must concentrate minds in the west at a critical moment", "published": "Tue 14 May 2024 20.13 CEST", "content": "Antony Blinken’s unannounced visit to Kyiv on Tuesday was a welcome and timely show of support. It was the US secretary of state’s first trip to Ukraine since America belatedly signed off on a $61bn aid package last month, allowing a desperately needed supply of new arms to finally flow to troops in the east. As Mr Blinken met President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in the capital, events continued to underline how urgently such assistance – and much more of the same – is required.The ultimate scope of Russia’s significant offensive in the Kharkiv region is yet to become clear. In part it may be intended to create a buffer zone, protecting Russian territory close to the north-east border. But as thousands of residents are once more displaced, and the prospect looms of a huge artillery assault on the city of Kharkiv, the incursions are also diverting threadbare Ukrainian resources from the eastern front. That may facilitate new Russian breakthroughs in the Donbas region.Faced with a war of attrition along a vast frontline – and with recruitment a pressing and increasingly fraught issue – Ukrainian forces are outnumbered and outgunned. But the west could have done more in recent months to bolster defences, in anticipation of an offensive of this kind. The horror that has unfolded in Israel and Gaza has diverted international attention and focus. Political dysfunction in Washington, and a cumbersome decision-making and delivery process in Brussels, have compounded the problem. In consequence, Ukraine’s military risks being left short, as what may be a crucial phase in Vladimir Putin’s brutal, illegal war begins.As he has been obliged to do with allies throughout the war, Mr Zelenskiy welcomed Mr Blinken by expressing gratitude for the help received, while urgently pleading for more. The west has been wary of delivering long-range weapons that could be used to take the war deep into Russian territory. But upping the pace and level of assistance need not cross red lines. Two more air defence systems, Mr Zelenskiy told the secretary of state, were necessary for the defence of Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second city. As relentless Russian aerial barrages have become bigger and more sophisticated, limited resources are forcing Ukrainian commanders to choose between defending urban centres and crucial infrastructure. A reboot of defensive capacities is required if they are not to risk being overwhelmed.Mr Blinken’s visit was also timely for a second reason. Almost a thousand miles to the south of Kharkiv, in Tbilisi, the Georgian ruling party’s flirtations with a pro-Moscow position are coming to a dangerous and violent head. The appointment earlier this year of a new pro-Russian prime minister, after a government reshuffle, has been followed by a crackdown on LGBTQ+ rights and a new “foreign agents” bill, passed in the Georgian parliament on Tuesday.Transparently, the purpose of the law is to legitimise harassment and stigmatisation of civil rights groups and non-governmental organisations deemed to be promoting a liberal, “pro-western” agenda. The seemingly deliberate jeopardising of Georgia’s ambitions to join the EU, which has condemned the thuggish suppression of protests against the bill, points ominously towards the kind of Russian-influenced destabilisation already evident in Moldova.Events in Tbilisi underline the geopolitical stakes being played for as Mr Putin seeks to grind out a winning position of strength in Ukraine, and reconstitute Russian hegemony elsewhere. As the pace suddenly quickens after a period of relative stalemate, and the Kremlin seeks to overwhelm Kyiv through sheer weight of numbers and materiel, the west must keep its focus and ensure that Ukraine continues to receive backing.Explore more on these topicsUkraineOpinionUS foreign policyAntony BlinkenEuropeRussiaVolodymyr ZelenskiyForeign policyeditorialsShareReuse this content", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/may/14/the-guardian-view-on-russia-new-offensive-ukraine-allies-must-renew-their-focus"},
{"headline": "When Suella Braverman lectures Labour on child poverty, something is very wrong", "author": "Gaby Hinsliff", "teaser": "If even the Tory right-winger sees political capital in opposing the two-child benefit cap, Keir Starmer needs to think again", "published": "Tue 14 May 2024 11.00 CEST", "content": "Suella Braverman wants to help lift children out of poverty by scrapping one of her party’s harshest welfare policies. Yes, I do mean that Suella Braverman; and no, I can’t quite believe I’m typing these words either. Then again, who thought Natalie Elphicke would ever defect to Labour? Sometimes lions really do lie down with lambs, though you can see why lambs tend to have very mixed feelings about it.Anyway, writing in the not exactly bleeding heart Sunday Telegraph, Braverman unexpectedly joined a long line of children’s charities and expert reports who have been pointing out for almost seven years now that the two-child benefits limit – which prevents families claiming tax credits or universal credit for a third or subsequent child born after 2017 – is plunging ever more families into desperate circumstances while failing to achieve what its author George Osborne said it would, which is incentivise work.This is because 59% of families affected have at least one partner working already, and their problem is mostly that they’re not actually paid enough to survive on work alone. As for making poorer parents think twice about having children, plenty of people either don’t realise they’ll be caught by it until too late, or get pregnant in good times only to endure an unexpected run of subsequent bad luck.What the policy definitely has done, however, is help ensure that 43% of families with three or more children are now living in poverty. It’s not just cruel but hopelessly ineffective on its own terms, and pretty much everyone in the Labour party knows it. How galling, then, to find themselves lectured from the moral high ground not just by Braverman but by Scotland’s brand new first minister, John Swinney, who renewed calls for a future Labour government to scrap the limit within days of being appointed.The trouble with outflanking the Tories to the right as boldly as Keir Starmer has done is that it leaves his party defending a frankly implausible swathe of political territory, and not just from an attack by the left. In his wildest dreams Starmer presumably didn’t imagine someone like Braverman taking advantage of his exposed flank, any more than Labour MPs imagined having to defend a loose cannon like Elphicke against everything her former Tory colleagues can throw at her. But as confusing as all this shaking of the political kaleidoscope is, it does throw up some intriguing opportunities.Scrapping the two-child limit would take almost half a million children out of poverty, at a cost of about £2.5bn by 2024-25. It’s money that the shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, doesn’t currently have, but then she doesn’t have the money to raise defence spending to 2.5% of GDP either yet, and Labour is nonetheless promising to do that as soon as funds allow.In both cases, cutting corners now could cost this country dearly in future. Though tackling child poverty is expensive, not tackling something with profound lifelong implications for health, education, employment and welfare is likely to cost billions more over the long term. Frankly, I’d be amazed if a future Labour government didn’t end up spending some of the proceeds of that future growth it keeps promising on alleviating poverty, just as it did when last in power. So why not say something more explicit?Why is Britain’s mental health so incredibly poor? It’s because our society is spiralling backwards | George MonbiotRead moreThe crude answer is that the two-child limit remains bizarrely popular, with 60% of voters polled by YouGov last summer keen to keep it. What makes Braverman’s intervention interesting, however, is that together with Swinney’s it shows how an otherwise wildly improbable coalition for changing minds may emerge.Of the two, Swinney represents the more serious threat to a Labour party that badly needs to win back seats in Scotland. By promising to eradicate child poverty, just as Gordon Brown once did, the SNP is reminding potential defectors to Labour of a radical edge they sense is still missing under Starmer.Braverman, by contrast, is more closely allied with rightwing pro-natalist Tory MPs who see falling birthrates as an existential threat to the west’s survival, and want the welfare state reengineered to support bigger families rather than discouraging them. This is where lions and lambs generally part company, of course: few in the Labour party would be comfortable fighting this particular corner with her.But it’s not impossible to see a future Labour government finding itself awkwardly squeezed on the two-child policy between a hard-right culture war party led by someone like Braverman and its own disappointed critics on the left, over a position many Labour MPs already feel deeply uncomfortable defending. There’s one obvious way out of that.

{"headline": "What should Labour learn from Sadiq Khan? Take a stand – and don’t back down", "author": "John McTernan", "teaser": "From Ulez to free school meals, London’s mayor introduced bold, principled policies – and won. Keir Starmer, take note", "published": "Fri 10 May 2024 11.00 CEST", "content": "Maybe it’s because I’m a Londoner, but I never doubted that Sadiq Khan would win re-election as the city’s mayor – even when rumours of a surprise upset were being breathlessly repeated. Of course, Labour has always had the ability to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory. But this has meant that the party is all too often fearful in the face of large opinion poll leads, with an electoral strategy defined by the lessons of painful defeats.The time has come to learn from winning, and where better to start than Khan’s win in London. This was, to borrow the words of the former Australian Labor prime minister Paul Keating, the “sweetest victory of all” – a victory for the true believers. What has gained Khan the two largest personal mandates in British electoral history has been his politics.The London mayoralty was the inspiration for the metro mayors who are now such a firm fixture of English politics. And it broke so much new ground. Ken Livingstone was the first mayor – and, like Ben Houchen, re-elected Conservative mayor of Tees Valley last week, Livingstone ran against his party. He saw transport as critical, something that Andy Burnham has picked up with Manchester’s Bee Network and Steve Rotheram with Merseyrail, which is setting a template for Labour’s renationalisation of rail.This is the real politics of devolution. Creating leaders with their own mandates and voices – politicians whose innovations can be copied. In Khan’s case, his lessons for Labour are about navigating the changing contours of British politics.Currently, political discourse remains relentlessly focused on the battle on the right of British politics. The 26-point swing to Labour in Blackpool South was barely discussed. Not because it was the fifth swing of more than 20% from Tories to Labour in this parliament – a record better than New Labour in the run-up to 1997 – but rather because the Reform party were held in third place by the Tories.Who cares? Really, who cares – apart from Rishi Sunak and No 10 – about the battles within, and for, a third of British voters? Labour’s dominance in the polls seems to have obscured the core fact that the future of the country – and the success or failure of the Labour party – is bound up with the other two-thirds of voters who are supporting progressive parties.Adopting modern marketing speak, Keir Starmer’s Labour has identified its “hero voters” and focused relentlessly on them. While this was understandable following the rout of the 2019 election and the collapse of parts of the “red wall” into Tory hands, the fact is that the real realignment in British politics is on the centre left. Labour needs to worry about losing votes to the Lib Dems, Greens and independents rather than fixate on one particular image of rightwing voters.When you’re on 45% in the polls, half of all voters should be your “heroes” – and Khan gets that. He called Gaza right, speaking out for a ceasefire on 27 October last year when it was becoming clear that the humanitarian case was becoming overwhelming. It was a moral position, but it was also a recognition of what Labour’s base wanted – young Londoners, graduates and ethnic-minority voters. London Labour didn’t face the same challenge of independents that took seats across England and got almost one in eight votes in the West Midlands mayoral campaign. Khan knows political representation is a dialogue – you lead, but you also need to follow, or rather channel, your electorate.And he isn’t afraid to lead. The expansion of the ultra-low emission zone (Ulez) didn’t create a powerful car lobby – that has existed for a long time. His triumph over that lobby is instructive and will be critical in Labour’s first term in government, should it win – the need to replace fuel duty with road charging will become urgent because of revenue being lost by the transition to electric vehicles. Khan understood that in London there is a majority for clean air: he squeezed the progressive vote, winning the support of a Lib Dem voters in the capital, and seeing the Green vote fall while his rose. The same is likely to be true elsewhere.He also stands and fights. The mayor didn’t back off when Ulez was attacked – he stood his ground. That’s a model for Labour, which needs to be seen to stand for something. He also keeps moving. His policy of free school meals for primary pupils is just the kind of progressive universalism that the Labour party should follow.The coming general election will show the extent to which the pandemic and the change to working from home – and rising house prices – has exported a Labour-leaning London electorate to the greater south-east of England. Local election results, from Aldershot to Colchester, suggest this is a boost for Starmer’s chances. But Khan’s victory is ultimately a vindication that, in the end, good policies are good politics.\n John McTernan was political secretary to Tony Blair and is now a political strategist for BCW\n Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Even as the former head of the UN climate change convention that achieved the Paris agreement in 2015, I, like many, can succumb to believing in the worst possible outcome. Just after I assumed the role of UN climate chief in 2010, I said to a room full of reporters that I didn’t believe a global agreement on climate would be possible in my lifetime.Now, scientists say we are on track to shoot through the 1.5C temperature ceiling enshrined in the Paris agreement, leading to a dystopian world plagued with famine, conflict and unbearable heat. Climate impacts have hit so fast that worst-case scenarios predicted by scientists are in some cases already coming true.This isn’t scaremongering: these climate scientists are doing their job. They are telling us where we are, but now it’s up to the rest of us to decide what this moment requires of us and to radically change the direction of travel.Collective doubt in our ability to respond to the climate crisis is by now dangerously pervasive. Beyond climate scientists, it’s shared by politicians and some young people. It’s also shared by some philanthropists who fund climate NGOs, and by many who work in those NGOs. It is shared by some financiers, and some of those who work in companies struggling to reduce their emissions.View image in fullscreenChristiana Figueres, left, UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon, French foreign secretary Laurent Fabius and French president François Hollande celebrate at the Paris UN climate conference in 2015. Photograph: Stéphane Mahé/ReutersA sense of despair is understandable, but it robs us of our agency, makes us vulnerable to mis- and disinformation, and prevents the radical collaboration we need. Doubt holds us back from taking bold action, which is why it is strategically seized upon by incumbents, who have invested millions of dollars (probably much more) in sowing uncertainty around the climate crisis and its solutions among the general public.We all have a right to grieve the loss of a future free from the climate crisis. It is a deep, hard loss. And it’s particularly painful, because those of us who read these reports bear a great responsibility in passing an unsafe planet on to our children and future generations. But grief that stops at despair is an ending that I and many others, most notably those on the frontlines, are not prepared to accept.We also have the responsibility – and the opportunity – to shape the future differently. We must take stock of the science, triple down on our efforts and deploy the perspective of possibility.For example, what has been achieved in transforming the energy system to this point, pushing against a fossil fuel industry deliberately intent on delaying progress, and within a lacklustre policy environment, is extraordinary.We also learned this week that we have just reached a crucial turning point towards powering our world with clean energy. Last year saw a record absolute increase in solar generation. With renewables in the energy mix now at 30%, fossil fuel generation is expected to fall this year and then decline rapidly in the near future. Solar, in particular, is accelerating faster than anyone thought possible: last year it was the fastest growing source of electricity generation for the 19th year in a row. This really is the beginning of a different kind of future. Not enough, by itself, of course, but it shows a reality that is exponentially changing day by day.While we grapple with the current lack of political will, and the abhorrent inequities of the climate crisis, we can take some comfort that so many of those who are key to designing our future have heard climate scientists’ urgent warnings and are channelling their spirit by taking positive action in response: think of the engineers reforming our grids, the architects, the social entrepreneurs, the regenerative farmers restoring our soil, the legal advocates, and the millions of people everywhere who are advancing new systems of care, repair and regeneration.‘The stakes could not be higher’: world is on edge of climate abyss, UN warnsRead moreIt will take much more courageous collective action to turn the seemingly impossible into the new normal. But we are on the brink of positive societal tipping points. I believe that the children of children born this year will be the first fossil-fuel-free generation in modern history. Their generation, just a few years from now, will benefit from development and smart climate adaptation based on the certainty of abundant, homegrown and distributed clean energy. It doesn’t mean they will live in a utopian future – we know too much climate change is already baked into the system – but enormous positive change is coming.I mentioned earlier telling the press that I didn’t believe a global agreement on climate was possible back in 2010. What I didn’t share is that I immediately afterwards had to change my attitude. And that made all the difference. It was a candle in the darkness that I used to light a spark in many others. I am still using the candle of stubborn optimism today – and I’m not the only one.A world in which we pass 1.5C is not set in stone.\n Christiana Figueres was the head of the UN climate change convention from 2010 to 2016, and is the co-host of the climate podcast Outrage + Optimism\nExplore more on these topicsClimate crisisOpinionFossil fuelsSolar powerRenewable energyEnergyChristiana FigueresUnited NationscommentShareReuse this content", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/may/09/climate-scientists-despair-stubborn-optimism-paris-2015-climate"},

But that wasn’t really lying, I would tell myself, it was an act of kindness!And then I had a therapy session, where I realised that all of this was actually people-pleasing behaviour and it turned out I was a prolific liar. Not only that, but according to my therapist, by constantly hiding my true feelings to protect those I loved, I was blocking them from ever getting to know the real me and creating true intimacy.Slowly, I realised that every time I pretended I loved that thing my partner did, or lied about how fun it would be to go away for a friend’s birthday, or forced myself on yet another hen do, I was lying. I was prioritising everyone else over myself, and it meant that inside, I was raging with resentment.I knew something had to change. So, in that moment, I vowed I would never tell another lie again. Not a single one. Even a white lie. I was done abandoning my own needs and hiding myself from my loved ones. It was time to show them the real me.That was two years ago, and I haven’t lied since. I’ve wanted to – especially when it involves admitting something I find embarrassing (like being a yoga teacher who can’t do an unsupported handstand), or when I’ve had to let someone down. I’ve been racked with guilt after cancelling on people without the overly long made-up apology texts I used to send, instead simply admitting I’m not feeling up to it. And I’ve made mistakes, telling white lies, then realising what I’ve done: “Sorry, I just accidentally lied … I haven’t actually read your book, but I do want to!”It was particularly hard at the start. It would take me hours to reply to a “do you fancy a coffee?” text when my answer was “no”. I would agonise over whether it was true to say, “Sorry, I can’t,” eventually settling on, “I’m not available, but will let you know when I am!”, followed by an excessive number of emojis to soften the blow. And I’d squirm with discomfort every time I had to tell someone something I knew they didn’t want to hear. From small things, like confessing that I couldn’t eat the dessert they had just made me because it contained gluten (previously, I would have lied or forced myself to eat it), or telling a friend I didn’t have the space to see them that week – or the week after.As a stunt performer, I lived on the edge of danger – but I had to step back from the precipice | Janine ParkinsonRead moreBut gradually, I realised I didn’t actually know what they wanted to hear, and I never had done at all. Because more often than not, I’d cancel on friends and instead of being disappointed, they’d be thrilled, replying: “Oh great, I wasn’t feeling up to it either!”Once, I did something I’d never imagined I was capable of. I told a once-close friend that I felt we’d been growing apart, and perhaps it was best if we stopped seeing each other. I expected her to be devastated or furious. The reality? She was relieved I’d called it out so we could stop “flogging a dead horse”.By telling the truth, I wasn’t, as I had falsely believed before, pushing people away until I was left completely alone (my greatest fear). If anything, I was becoming closer to those I really connected with, and gently letting go of those I didn’t. Some did initially struggle because they weren’t used to my honesty – whether it was me giving a candid opinion on their new Asos purchase, or voicing how hard I found it when they flaked on plans last-minute.But slowly, people began to express their gratitude for my newfound honesty. I’ll never forget the first time a friend thanked me for it: “I feel so safe in our friendship because I don’t have to second guess anything. I know if I’ve upset you, you’ll just tell me!” That was when I truly saw what I’d been denying myself in all those years of lying: the chance to be accepted for who I am. My friends wouldn’t leave me if I told the truth – they’d simply trust me.My experience inspired me to write a children’s novel about a girl who couldn’t lie. I’ve dedicated it to my younger self, and I hope it encourages a new generation to do what I’ve only just learned: to tell the truth.Radical honesty isn’t for the faint-hearted – I’ve had to face my greatest fears and feel the shame, guilt and discomfort that arise from having difficult conversations – but it’s one of the greatest joys I’ve ever discovered.I’ve learned that there’s really no need to lie. There is always a kind way to tell the truth, and if necessary, I can always say I’d rather not answer any question being asked of me. Because the alternative is no longer an option. Lying is a disservice to myself and to the person on the receiving end.It’s why I’m fully committed to maintaining my vow of honesty. I have no idea where it will take me, and I’m sure many more awkward conversations await me, but at least I’ll always be living a life of total authenticity.\n Radhika Sanghani is a writer and author.

{"headline": "So Russell Brand was baptised in the Thames, and all his sins were washed away. Cheaper than a lawyer, I suppose ", "author": "Marina Hyde", "teaser": "His journey to Christianity was very moving, and infinitely more spiritual than his trip to the police station to deny criminal allegations", "published": "Tue 14 May 2024 17.21 CEST", "content": "A hazmat dredger, please, to the stretch of the River Thames in which Russell Brand was recently baptised, in an event apparently conducted by TV adventurer and chief scout Bear Grylls. I know, it’s incredible: Thames Water is no longer responsible for the biggest piece of shit in the river.In his mystical biography of the Thames, Peter Ackroyd observed: “There are some parts of the river that create or harbour distinct properties that are not susceptible to rational analysis.” And I think we might be dealing with one of those properties right here. Rational analysis deserts me as I survey a recently released photo of a topless Brand, a topless Bear, and the unidentified owner of what appears to be an S-reg Japanese hannya mask back tattoo embracing in the waist-deep current. Then again, it’s possible the third figure is actually identified. The Brand-penned caption on this Insta-trocity runs: “Me, Bear Grylls, The River Thames and of course, The Holy Spirit.” Sorry, but does the Holy Spirit now have a back tattoo? Game’s gone.Theodicy is an attempt to reconcile a just God with a world of suffering, but in this case the problem is having to explain how on earth this lot weren’t made to suffer far more, with at least E coli, for this ludicrous spectacle. But before we go any further, a reminder that Brand has been accused of rape, sexual assault and emotional abuse by at least four women in a joint investigation last year by Channel 4’s Dispatches and the Sunday Times. He has been questioned twice under caution by the Metropolitan police and denies all the allegations. On the other hand, the Sachsgate alumnus will always retain goodwill for his endorsement swinging the 2015 general election for Labour.View image in fullscreenRussell Brand in Los Angeles, January 2020. Photograph: Lester Cohen/Getty Images for The Recording AcademyIt’s fair to say this was not explicitly touched on by Grylls in his stated reflection on the baptism, which simply declared: “Faith and spiritual moments in our lives are really personal, but it is a privilege to stand beside anyone when they express a humble need for forgiveness and strength from above.” Righto. Has Brand asked for forgiveness from the 16-year-old schoolgirl who alleges he sent cars to her school to bring her to his house (he denies it all), or is he focusing on “from above” as a useful generalised covering-off device – the Notes-app apology of taking responsibility? Or indeed, speaking of tattoos, the “Only God Can Judge Me” tattoo of taking responsibility? (I very much enjoyed the intro to a news story last year which ran: “A man whose many tattoos include Tupac Shakur’s ‘Only God Can Judge Me’ appeared before Miami-Dade judges on Thursday and Friday in bond court.”)Anyway, back to the Grylls statement on the Brand baptism, which concludes: “Friendships when we go through tough times are worth so much.” What twee twattery is this? Please picture it cross-stitched into a sampler and wall-mounted in whatever five-star Costa Rican hotel room Bear’s staying in during the filming of upcoming Netflix series Bear Hunt, presented by former This Morning co-host Holly Willoughby. Poor Holly. You travel half the way across the world to escape brand contamination, then your co-star comes down with Brand contamination.As for Bear, his decision to yoke himself to Brand is intriguing. Their friendship seems to have begun last year, when Russell filmed an episode of his Apple show Running Wild With Bear Grylls in the Hebrides, although that was before The Unpleasantness emerged. To see it persist afterwards has raised a number of eyebrows. But of course Grylls is, famously, a great advocate for embracing risk in life. And with this latest buddyship, he definitely runs the risk of troubling his employers at the Scout Association who, for obvious historic reasons, probably don’t feel an immense need for their chief scout to be creep-adjacent.Yet the question of what really draws the two men to each other is arguably less obscure than it seems. Certainly neither is held back by self-doubt. Both are prone to emanating a certain sense that the rules that apply to lesser mortals are an affront to themselves. Discussing his financial affairs, Grylls once told an interviewer: “I find it demoralising to pay income tax at 40 per cent when I work really hard and spend a lot of time away from my family.” Mm. Can’t help feeling he should toughen up a bit.There’s not a whole lot less appealing than someone now worth an estimated £20m whining about paying his fair share like everyone else from nurses to teachers. That said, I’m a huge fan of people who talk about making extremely lucrative TV shows like it’s a tour of duty in Afghanistan. Appallingly, Bear’s only got an OBE. Where’s his George Cross for taking down Una from the Saturdays in the Central American jungle?Concluding with Brand, his spiritual journey has been what you might expect of a bog-standard sex-case-turned-wingnut. He was previously a Buddhist, then earlier this year began endorsing a Roman Catholic prayer app called Hallow, and seems to have settled for now on whichever branch of the Anglican faith permits telly survivalists to rebirth you. “Week one as a Christian has been amazing,” Brand said the other day, adding that he felt “changed, transitioned”. Onlookers are unlikely to spot the difference. He still has a conspiracist TV portal in which viewers are treated to material on the deep state/Bill Gates/the plandemic – in short, all the usual suspects of the usual suspects. It’s hard to know how long his conversion will last. But you can’t help thinking there will only be room for one messiah in that relationship – and unfortunately, it won’t be Jesus.\n Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnist\nDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

{"headline": "Joe Biden is desperate for this war to end – but neither Netanyahu nor Hamas is in any hurry", "author": "Jonathan Freedland", "teaser": "Failing to stop an all-out attack on Rafah would make the US president look weak – an unthinkable prospect in election year", "published": "Fri 10 May 2024 18.25 CEST", "content": "Beware cornering a US president anxious about re-election. Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly ignored that advice in his dealings with Joe Biden, and this week his country learned the price.It came in the revelation that Biden had withheld the supply of about 3,500 bombs, refusing to let US munitions play a part in an Israeli assault on the southern Gaza city of Rafah, where more than a million Palestinians have sought refuge. The president was at pains to say he was not giving up his “ironclad” commitment to Israel. Instead, it was just the specific, long-threatened Rafah operation that he would not back with weapons. “We’re not walking away from Israel’s security,” Biden told CNN. “We’re walking away from Israel’s ability to wage war in those areas.”To understand why this is such a big deal, remind yourself of the people and the countries involved. The US is Israel’s most crucial ally. Israel’s former prime minister Yitzhak Rabin used to say that his country’s number one strategic asset was not this or that weapon – not even its unconfirmed, and undenied, nuclear arsenal – but its relationship with Washington. For many decades, the US has served as Israel’s chief arms supplier and diplomatic protector. And yet in the space of less than six weeks, Washington has withheld its veto at the UN security council, allowing a resolution to pass in late March that Israel wanted blocked, and now it has closed the doors to at least part of its armoury.What’s more, these actions were taken by a man who is, by some distance, the most personally devoted supporter of Israel ever to sit in the Oval Office. Biden is a Democrat from the era when the notion of a restored Jewish homeland in the Middle East – promising an end to two millennia of exile and persecution – would turn US liberals misty-eyed. It takes little prompting for Biden to boast that he has met every Israeli leader since Golda Meir. Unlike past presidents, his affinity for Israel is not solely the product of electoral calculation: as his Jewish supporters put it, it’s in his kishkes. It’s in his guts.Meanwhile, Netanyahu came to prominence in the 1980s as an Israeli diplomat who spoke fluent American. He offered himself then and since as an expert on the US political landscape, a crucial skill for a would-be Israeli leader. For decades, his message to the Israeli electorate has been that only he – who stands in “another league” above his domestic rivals – can be trusted with the all-important US-Israel relationship.But look at the state of it now. Biden has become the first US president in more than four decades to deny Israel military aid in this way. (Ronald Reagan conveyed US fury after Israel’s invasion of Lebanon in 1982 by delaying a consignment of fighter planes.) And why has he done it? Because, under Netanyahu, a growing section of the US public is souring on Israel as never before.It’s true that a bedrock level of support for the country exists that may surprise those seeing daily footage of US campuses in ferment. When Gallup asked Americans in March where their sympathies lay, 51% stood with Israel, while 27% backed the Palestinians. But among Democrats and young people, it’s the Palestinians who prevail, by eight-point margins in both cases.Those are the numbers that weigh on Biden and his re-election team, as they face the unravelling of the coalition that defeated Donald Trump in 2020. A period of newly intense suffering in Gaza will alienate yet more of the voters they need to win. The White House asked Netanyahu to show them a plan that would achieve a goal they regarded as legitimate – the removal from Rafah of Hamas’s last remaining battalions – but without risking mass civilian casualties. Netanyahu could not do it. Which is why Washington has resorted to a more direct means of making him stop.It’s become a test of strength that Biden cannot afford to lose. He made an all-out attack on Rafah a red line: if Netanyahu crosses it, that makes Biden look weak. Facing an opponent, Trump, determined to make strong v weak the defining choice of the coming election, he cannot let that stand.But still Netanyahu refuses to buckle, telling his people ahead of Israeli independence day that they will fight alone, without US arms, with their fingernails, if they have to. He wants to sound Churchillian, but these are words of weakness, not strength. For he is pulled in two directions: Washington wants him to stay out of Rafah, while his far-right coalition partners, the ultra-nationalists Bezalel Smotrich and Itamar Ben-Gvir, insist he go in hard, to finish the job and win a “total victory” over Hamas.US support may be essential for Israel’s national interest, but in a contest of Biden v Ben-Gvir, there was only going to be one winner. Without the latter’s support, Netanyahu loses his coalition. Suddenly, he will have to face the voters itching to punish him for the failures that led to 7 October, as well as the courts, for a resumed trial on charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust. Which is why he will always buckle to the bigots to his right. It may have Netanyahu’s name on it, but this is Ben-Gvir’s government now.It’s the same logic that has led Netanyahu to drag his feet in talks to broker a ceasefire and release the Israeli hostages still held in the darkness by Hamas. Biden wants him to do a deal, because Biden needs this war over. The Israeli public want him to do a deal, because they are desperate to bring the captives home. But Ben-Gvir is the man who opposed the last and only agreed hostage release deal, back in November. He prefers to keep pounding Gaza, harder and harder, in search of an illusory and impossible victory. And because that’s what Ben-Gvir wants, that’s what Netanyahu gives him – even if it means pushing Biden into an ever tighter corner.Still, Biden and Netanyahu are not the only players in this bleak drama. Yahya Sinwar, Hamas’s leader in Gaza, has his own calculations, his own determination to remain in charge. Those who have studied him closely believe his priority is not so much an end to the killing of innocent civilians – on the contrary, the more Gazans who die, the more damage that does to the international standing of his enemy, Israel – but rather a scenario that allows him to claim victory. Sinwar thought he had that earlier this week, with the deal Hamas loudly accepted. The stumbling block is the agreed duration of any cessation of violence. Sinwar does not want it to be temporary, even if that would save many lives and ease the misery of Gaza. He wants a declaration that the war is permanently over. And for that he can wait.And so there is no deal, because neither Netanyahu nor Sinwar believes what’s on offer serves their interests. As the former US state department official Aaron David Miller puts it: “The only party that’s really in a hurry is Biden.” Though that’s not quite right. Also in a hurry are the hostages and their families, whose agony has endured for more than 200 days, and the civilians of Rafah, huddled in tents, grieving their tens of thousands of dead, without running water or sanitation. They’re in a hurry too. But no one is listening to them.\n Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist\n Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

{"headline": "Cries of defiance are all Palestinians and their supporters have left to keep hope alive", "author": "Nesrine Malik", "teaser": "Acts of solidarity will be demonised and slogans will be twisted, but they have never been more important", "published": "Mon 13 May 2024 07.00 CEST", "content": "In 1988, the Syrian poet Nizar Qabbani, the most celebrated Arab poet of the modern era, wrote The Trilogy of the Children of the Stones. The poem was dedicated to the children of the first Palestinian intifada, who, in hurling stones at Israeli soldiers, became symbols of the era. The intifada was triggered in 1987 by frustration over the Israeli occupation in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, and was characterised by civil disobedience, non-violent protest and, most iconically, those children.“O Children of Gaza, don’t mind our broadcasts”, Qabbani wrote, counting himself as part of an older generation whose attempts at compromise with Israel had failed to deliver freedom for the Palestinians. “Don’t listen to us / We are the people of cold calculation … The age of political reason has long departed / So teach us madness.”Qabbani was part of an Arabic tradition of art and literature that channelled the despair of the Palestinians, and how their only recourse was the “madness” of children throwing rocks at a heavily armed force. How all they had left was a refusal to accept their defeat and to tilt against the powerful – without allies, at huge risk and without a plan. As long as that happened, Palestine still existed, a place kept alive through the assertion that its people were still here, still claiming their right to their identity, still free simply as a result of never abandoning that claim. Followed closely in a region ruled by autocrats, military men and absolute monarchies, the first intifada planted its message deep in the popular Arab psyche: political overlords could control everything but people’s right to nurse a vision of what they deserve.To those from that generation, and I am one of them, the word “intifada” meant just that; the “shaking off”, the convulsion, the uprising. To our ears it meant a demand for civil rights rather than violence and bloodshed. It was also a word that had no explicit end goal, no specific purpose other than to refuse and resist – a demonstration of rootedness.Ana Dammi Falastini (“My blood is Palestinian”), a 2015 popular protest song that has been played during protests in the west, builds on this theme. It’s also notable that its Palestinian singer, Mohammed Assaf, won the second series of Arab Idol in 2013 after a competition in which he performed traditional Palestinian songs that captured the hearts and minds of the pan-Arab viewership.View image in fullscreenPro-Palestine student protest in central London, 11 May 2024. Photograph: Vuk Valcic/Zuma Press Wire/REX/ShutterstockAlong with many other poems, artworks, works of literature and snippets of quotes and slogans, these examples constitute an entire heritage of Palestinian identity forged not on western campuses or in western media, but in refugee camps, on the remaining walls of bulldozed houses, in prisons and in segregated populations, among those driven from their homes and yearning for a right of return. Together they create a notional place, disembodied from wretched reality, that nurtures solace, bravado and connection between a scattered and uprooted people who aspire to something you and I take for granted: statehood.The passing of this culture into mainstream English language discourse since 7 October has reduced the words within it to literal meanings, projected on to them by observers with little knowledge of their history and nuances. The term intifada has been treated as nothing short of an unambiguous declaration of holy war. The phrase “From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free”, which doesn’t originate in Arabic but expresses a Palestinian longing for their historic homeland, has been stretched to imply nothing that it says. Britain’s then-home secretary Suella Braverman said it was “widely understood as a demand for the destruction of Israel”. But how exactly Palestine will be free is not something the Palestinian people have ever had the privilege of fully specifying.In Oslo, they were offered not even an outline of the borders of what could become a Palestinian entity, and no right of return to the homes they had been driven out of since 1948. In 2020, Donald Trump’s peace plan did not even offer them full statehood. In the light of 7 October, it is understandable that, to some, expressions of Palestinian uprising and claims to land take on a threatening pall. But the story of these terms and chants is much longer than the one condensed and condemned over the past seven months. A Palestinian history of resistance, which spans decades of expulsion, massacre, humiliation, segregation and surveillance, is not represented exclusively by Hamas.There is also something about the projection of lurid intentions on to Palestinian solidarity and calls for self-determination that misreads the very nature of protest as something that needs to be measured and rational (in ways that are never quite specified) for it to be credible. But protest becomes necessary precisely because authorities have not been responsive. And it is defined by asymmetry of power and access to political tools. Politicians have executive power, and protesters have one thing: their voices. Protest movements are by their very nature performances of opposition and they often have this miraculously consistent quality – quickly expanding from political spaces to community ones, incorporating song, dance, poetry and protective fraternity among strangers.Crushing these spaces – and the causes they represent – is most effectively done not by brute force, but in portraying the participants as villains. Hence the image of such people as Putin-backed, pro-Hamas, or led by professional infiltrators. The harder it is to discredit the earnestness and necessity of Palestinian solidarity, the wilder such allegations become.It is now clear that the hundreds of thousands of protesters who march for Gaza, from London to Washington, are not hate marchers. A study reported last week found that 97% of US campus demonstrations over Gaza have been peaceful. But what makes the propaganda war against Palestinian solidarity most urgent is the fact that Hamas’s bloody actions on 7 October are clearly no longer a credible alibi for what Israel is doing. The smear effort is constantly thwarted by relentless scenes of death and starvation in Gaza, and indeed the belligerent words of Israeli authorities themselves: representatives of a powerful US-backed, nuclear state who are not subject to the same restrictions as the scrutinised slogans of protesters that fade into the air.In such a world, as Gaza is razed, what is left but to continue to construct, more vividly and forcibly than ever before, a Palestinian identity defined by its right to exist rather than its risk of erasure? What is left but to continue to reject this age where political reason has long departed?\n Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnist\n Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

{"headline": "Something is stirring in England: right to buy looks imperilled, and not a moment too soon", "author": "John Harris", "teaser": "It was Thatcher’s most dire piece of social engineering. Labour’s leadership can’t keep ignoring the voices now raised against it", "published": "Sun 12 May 2024 13.59 CEST", "content": "More than a decade after her death and 34 years since she left Downing Street, Margaret Thatcher continues to haunt us. After Liz Truss’s cosplay as the Iron Lady, Rishi Sunak has drawn comparisons between “the grocer’s daughter and the pharmacist’s son”. In December last year, Keir Starmer admiringly said that Thatcher “set loose our natural entrepreneurialism”. All this suggests a very British mixture of muddle and masochism: her spirit, it seems, must be summoned so we can be magicked out of our current mess, even if so many of the UK’s crises began with what she did.One of her most painful legacies is the policy that defined her political essence: right to buy, that totemic scheme whereby the tenants of council houses and flats can purchase such properties at a discount, and become members of what Conservatives call the property-owning democracy. Since it was introduced in 1980, more than 2m dwellings have moved from the public realm into private hands. Stringent restrictions preventing councils spending the receipts on new homes have had predictable effects: since 1991, there has been an average net loss of 24,000 social homes a year. All this feeds our ever-worsening housing crisis – and, as a result, the fragile condition of millions of ordinary lives.Meanwhile, right to buy is increasingly resurfacing in our politics. Look, for example, at Angela Rayner, and the absurd controversy cooked up by the Conservatives and their allies in the press. The story of a former council house she bought in 2007 with a 25% discount and then sold eight years later is replete not just with a ridiculous antipathy to exactly what the policy was designed to achieve – working-class people making a bit of money – but a proprietorial sense of who right to buy belongs to. Clearly, Tories still see the policy as a shining symbol of Thatcher’s greatness, and any left-leaning beneficiaries of it open themselves to allegations of hypocrisy.Right to buy also crops up in the backstory of Starmer’s seemingly omnipotent campaign director, Morgan McSweeney. According to a brilliant profile published on Saturday by the journalist Tom McTague, one of the key reasons he insists that Labour must doggedly maintain the support of its traditional working-class base lies in his early experiences overseeing community relations in Barking and Dagenham – the outer London borough that, between 2006 and 2010, saw Labour’s dominance threatened by the neo-fascist British National party. That change was partly traceable to right to buy’s awful local legacy, which I have seen close-up: huge numbers of former council houses first sold to tenants being snapped up by absentee landlords, and then left to fall into squalor. One of McSweeney’s object lessons in the importance of nitty-gritty politics was the success of an “eyesore gardens policy”: the Labour-run council removing the rubbish outside people’s houses, and then billing the landlords for the work.Though it has pledged to reduce discounts, Labour still supports right to buy, seemingly because to do anything that fundamentally threatened it would invite unwelcome questions about the party’s support for “aspiration”. But increasing numbers of influential voices, in Labour and other parties, have long since decided that the policy needs to either be forced into retreat, or completely binned. In Scotland, having already scrapped it for new tenants, the SNP government legislated to get rid of right to buy in 2014. The Labour administration in Wales followed a similar path to abolition; at the 2019 election, the party’s UK manifesto promised to end it in England.I will build at least 10,000 council homes. As for right to buy – suspend it for new properties | Andy BurnhamRead moreIn 2023, Sadiq Khan said he wanted Whitehall to devolve the powers necessary to pause right to buy in London. And last week came another big demand for change: Labour’s Greater Manchester mayor, Andy Burnham, called on the government – and, by implication, his own party – to lift the right to buy requirement on new-build flats and houses, and give his plans to build 10,000 new social homes a firm foundation. As evidenced by his re-regulation of buses, Burnham seems set on belatedly avenging the worst political excesses of the 1980s.Something is obviously in the air. The last month has also seen two big policy reports about right to buy, making very similar suggestions. The latest, from the New Economics Foundation, is brimming with shocking findings: 40% of homes sold under the policy are now being let on the private market – in Brighton, the proportion is 86%. Worse still, discounts – which, in 2014, were increased to a maximum of 70% – enshrine one of right to buy’s worst aspects: the fact that it often means councils losing money on houses they build. Unless this changes, Burnham says, trying to solve the housing crisis is like trying to fill a bath but with the plug out. He’s right, but his comrades in Westminster still seem to be putting their fingers in their ears: “It’s an incoming government that would determine the rules around right to buy,” says the shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves. “We have no plans to reform that.”Particularly in cities, selling council houses sooner or later eats away at places’ sense of stability and continuity: once buy-to-let landlords enter the picture, most tenants tend to become transient and disconnected from where they live. At the same time, housing that once ensured families could still live in urban centres passes into very different hands. Back in 2016, I reported on a former council development a stone’s throw from Old Street roundabout in London called Quaker Court. Some former family homes were now let to students; another had been bought by a lone American resident who had two computers in his shed used for high-end financial trading. “It’s like a little Wall Street, in a back garden on a council estate,” said my guide. “This is what is happening.” As changes like these deepen, a strange silence descends, schools close, and any meaningful sense of community evaporates.But the effects of right to buy now afflict just about every corner of the country. Three weeks ago, that was the message conveyed by Julian Brazil, the Liberal Democrat leader of the district council that runs South Hams, in Devon. “Good luck to you if you’ve been lucky enough to take advantage of these schemes,” he wrote, “but the failure of government to replace these houses means future generations are paying the price. Once a council house has gone, it’s gone … We’ve lost millions of council houses due to right to buy and they need to be replaced.”Many Conservatives, amazingly enough, cling to the dream of right to buy being extended to housing associations, a mad idea that was announced by Boris Johnson in 2022 after being piloted, but has so far been avoided. If we are going to build social housing, we need to stop selling it off. Westminster politicians should devolve decisions on right to buy to politicians who can adjust housing policy to fit local realities, and face the electoral consequences if any significant numbers of people object. I doubt they would: the Thatcher era is long over, her ghostly powers are dwindling, and the dire legacy of her most radical bit of social engineering needs to finally be brought to a close.\n John Harris is a Guardian columnist\nExplore more on these topicsSocial housingOpinionRenting propertyHousing marketHousingMargaret ThatcherPropertyAndy BurnhamcommentShareReuse this content", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/may/12/england-right-to-buy-thatcher-labour-leadership"},
{"headline": "Piers Morgan won’t care where the Baby Reindeer saga goes. But Netflix should", "author": "Marina Hyde", "teaser": "An interview with the woman who allegedly inspired the stalker character has been the latest jaw-dropper in the hit show’s afterlife", "published": "Fri 10 May 2024 16.02 CEST", "content": "What will happen next in the still-mushrooming Baby Reindeer saga? Probably one or more of a number of bad things. Latest bad thing to happen (at time of writing) was Piers Morgan’s decision to pay the so-called real-life Martha – reportedly the inspiration for the stalker character in the Netflix programme – what she claims was £250 so he could interview her on his YouTube show. I always feel the most disingenuous gambit in journalism is the one that goes: “We just want to give you the chance to tell your side of the story …” Anyway, the resultant encounter dropped on Thursday night and was an object lesson in wild-west TV, which has already sparked condemnation from a number of angles. Let’s hope it doesn’t spark real-life events of its own.Clearly mindful of the criticisms that would be levelled at him for featuring someone UK news outlets had largely avoided even naming, Morgan approached his interviewee wearing a veneer of empathy. Ultimately, though, the Martha character’s enterprise would surely seem low-grade to all the people who edited tabloid newspapers in the not-too-distant past. After all, if you want someone relentlessly pursued, you just get the news desk to do it. Or a private detective. Or – but no. We daren’t all operate under the heroic “uncensored” banner.For now, a quick refresher. Baby Reindeer is the Netflix show written by and starring Richard Gadd, and a massive and critically acclaimed hit for the streamer. It tells Gadd’s story of being stalked, as well as his abuse at the hands of an exploitative TV figure, and is prefaced with the words: “This is a true story”. Not “based on a true story”, or “inspired by real events”, or all the other get-outs / get-ins that have made “based-on” crime an intellectual property genre all of its own, with Netflix particularly drawn to the tag.Within a sensationally short time of the show dropping, “Martha” had been identified from her own previous posts, while the TV figure plotline turned into one of those super-fun rapist guessing games, with some men wrongly identified and forced to call the police. Within the TV industry, particularly the five former analogue channels, jaws were dropping. This was surely a mega compliance failure?In a list of telly’s unsung heroes, broadcasters’ compliance departments would be right up there, ensuring that shows conform to standards and codes, for instance when they involve vulnerable or “real-life” people. When the Baby Reindeer controversy first kicked off, I joked to someone that I pictured the Netflix compliance department as just a single phone ringing out in a cupboard. I would like to expand on that comment by saying I’m pretty sure the compliance department at Piers Morgan Uncensored is a single 4ft-square tickbox on a wall beneath the slogan “WILL IT GET ME CLICKS?”But I guess that’s YouTube for you. And I have sympathy for channels and streamers creating shows in a world where social media platforms evidently couldn’t care less about ethics. However, this is the world we currently live in, and into which they knowingly put their shows, so more realism is urgently overdue from certain purveyors of real-life stories. You can find plenty who believe that “Martha” now receiving death threats and having people on her own doorstep is a form of just deserts. But ceding control of justice to the TikTok or X algorithm was grim in the Nicola Bulley case and others, and it’s grim now.So yes, without wishing to spaff Netflix’s billions for them, I think that if you paid your co-chief executive $49.8m last year, you can probably afford a half-arsed compliance department. The BBC pays the director-general, Tim Davie, £527,000 a year, and has a belt-and-braces compliance department. As Russell T Davies – who knows one or two things about writing drama based on real events – said this week, the BBC would have been “much stricter” about compliance in Baby Reindeer than Netflix. “Compliance and editorial policy drives us mad here,” he reflected, “but I sleep at night.”I’m guessing Netflix executives responsible for Baby Reindeer sleep the sleep of people who have just delivered a record-breaking international hit for a streamer that probably couldn’t give a toss about this sort of local handwringing. This isn’t the line the Netflix public policy director floated in front of a select committee on Wednesday, of course, with Benjamin King telling MPs that Netflix and the production company, Clerkenwell Films, had taken “every reasonable precaution in disguising the real-life identities of the people involved in that story”. Er … no. Admittedly, it was particularly tricky in the case of this material, with Gadd having addressed it in pre-existent Edinburgh fringe shows where the identification risks are obviously infinitely smaller than they are with a Netflix hit. But when the BBC made I May Destroy You with HBO and the production company Various Artists, I’m told meticulous care was taken to support Michaela Coel in telling the story of her sexual assault and her attempts to process it. There were independent lawyers, there was extensive pastoral support, and the defining characteristics of the real people were unidentifiably different. Did Netflix do this? Evidently not all of it.Strange, all things considered, that the government has spent much of the past few years honking that everything from the BBC to Channel 4 to the NHS should be “more like Netflix”. Meanwhile, if Baby Reindeer had been a BBC show, the resultant furore would have been framed vastly differently. Davie would have been forced to resign at least a week ago – his demise having been bayed for by many of the papers now cheerily covering the identification fallout. None of those news outlets would ever even dream of calling for Netflix’s Ted Sarandos to resign, of course. No, these big fish much prefer the feeding frenzy of the small pond.

This is beneath the dignity of a party on the verge of power", "published": "Thu 9 May 2024 14.00 CEST", "content": "No, no, this is an uncharacteristic mistake. Keir Starmer’s welcoming hand on Natalie Elphicke’s shoulder is a picture his enemies will relish as proof he was never really a Labour man. Where was the steadying hand of a Pat McFadden or Sue Gray to make him stop and think: just say no?It is easy to see how, in the hectic frenzy of 24-hour Westminster, the astonishing gift of the most comically unlikely MP crossing the floor at PMQs looked irresistible. The wow factor was a great theatrical coup, a sugar-rush of triumph. God knows what’s in it for her; some revenge for an unknown slight? Or a last-minute bid to dissociate herself from her nasty party? Maybe she’s just part of the great chicken run of “gissa job” Tory MPs clambering off before the Tory ship goes under.The notion that she’s defecting because Rishi Sunak has abandoned the centre ground, as she claimed, is laughable. She belonged to the Common Sense faction of Conservative MPs, one of the most rightwing cabals of culture warriors, chaired by Suella Braverman’s svengali, John Hayes, who would topple over if he moved any further right: fellow members include Jonathan Gullis, Edward Leigh, Andrew Rosindell, Danny Kruger and, formerly, Lee Anderson, until he scarpered to Reform. If she’d brought that whole crew over to crash his party, would Starmer have embraced them too?Policy discipline has been the hallmark of Starmer’s phenomenal revival of the party: ejecting anyone off-message, imprinting his brand on all candidates duly paraded, word-perfect, in recent byelection victories. Neil Kinnock, who expunged Militant, knows a thing or two about defining a party: “We’ve got to be choosy,” he told The Week in Westminster on BBC Radio 4. “It’s a very broad church but churches have walls and there are limits.”Glee over Elphicke plainly abandoned any intellectual definition of what it is to be “Labour”. Where was Elphicke’s line-by-line recantation of all her past atrocious sayings? Kate Osamor was given back the whip super-fast on the same day: she had long apologised for linking Gaza with the Holocaust. Diane Abbott must be taken back at once; she too has profusely apologised for making crass comments in April last year that Jewish, Traveller and Irish people don’t suffer discrimination as black people do. As long as Jeremy Corbyn stubbornly refuses to accept the Equality and Human Rights Commission’s findings on Labour antisemitism during his time as leader, he exiles himself.This is a one-day-wonder: Elphicke is not standing again and will be as forgotten as Christian Wakeford (if the name escapes you, he defected to Labour in 2022). Dr Dan Poulter’s hop across the floor last month drew a loud raspberry from inside the NHS. He said he could no longer look his NHS colleagues in the eye, after years, even as a health minister, of voting through the most brutal NHS funding cuts ever. But he’s the kind of Tory penitent Labour can accept, while Elphicke is off the scale.Defectors to the enemy are rare. The Tories, in post-Brexit turmoil, ejected a host of remainers, from Ken Clarke to David Gauke, Philip Hammond, Nicholas Soames and others, but they didn’t cross the floor, and some later had the whip restored. Politics is nothing if not viscerally tribal: look at the contempt in the Tory press today. But rats get barely more welcome from the bench they join, after the photo-op is over. Whips will be arm-twisting MPs to sit next to new-girl Natalie.Winston Churchill, who ratted and re-ratted, was a lonely, untrusted figure on the Tory benches he rejoined, until proved right about Hitler. Shaun Woodward, who abandoned his failed Tory party in 1999, had a chilly welcome from Labour, except from Tony Blair, who gave him the safe seat of St Helens South, high on the deprivation index and hardly suited to the only Labour MP with a butler. He never belonged.‘I understand why she moved’: Dover voters on Natalie Elphicke switching partiesRead moreThe public are ambivalent about party loyalty: they don’t like turncoats, but they don’t like servile obedience to whips either. They hate parties – a Europe-wide phenomenon, says Prof Tim Bale, chronicler of the decline in party loyalty. Perversely, they want independent-minded MPs yet they don’t elect parties riven by chaotic infighting. They complain about the quality of politicians, says Prof Rob Ford, yet refuse to take part, only a pathetic 1.5% of the British electorate deigning to join one of the three major parties. Most people do define themselves as right or left of centre as an identity, he says, but agree with a ragbag of policies that cross this line. Look at the very long list of MPs, mainly men, behaving badly, in a litany of sexual harassment, bullying or selling influence, but are MPs more aberrant than average? Ford says he often wonders – but no one knows: “If any organisation came under the same brutal scrutiny as MPs, how many would be exposed?”This is a one-day stumble for Keir Starmer. Elphicke will vanish into pub-quiz land. But, as rumours abound, other jumpers may follow: her admission to the party has set the lowest bar: if not her, can anyone be turned away?In the flutter of excitement, Labour high command momentarily forgot they are the masters now (almost). They need no defectors: all that matters is defecting voters, and I doubt Elphicke brings many. Dignity matters, and it devalues Labour membership to accept the dregs of the defeated party opposite.

{"headline": "Why is Britain’s mental health so incredibly poor? It’s because our society is spiralling backwards", "author": "George Monbiot", "teaser": "Even as neoliberalism destroys our dreams of a better life, politicians tell us ‘there is no alternative’. But there is", "published": "Fri 10 May 2024 07.00 CEST", "content": "The news should have stopped us in our tracks. Astonishingly, however, it was scarcely reported here. The latest map of mental wellbeing published by the Global Mind Project reveals that, out of the 71 countries it assessed, the United Kingdom, alongside South Africa, has the highest proportion of people in mental distress – and the second worst overall measure of mental health (we beat only Uzbekistan). Mental wellbeing has plummeted in the UK further than in any comparable nation. How was this not headline news?More importantly, why has it happened? The Global Mind Project blames smartphones and ultra-processed food. They doubtless play a role, but they’re hardly peculiar to the UK. I think part of the reason is the sense that life here is, visibly and obviously, spiralling backwards.There was a time when almost everyone in the UK believed the following promises. That a rising economic tide would lift all boats. That everybody would have a good home. That drudge work would diminish and jobs would become more interesting. That we would enjoy greater economic security and more leisure time. That educational attainment would keep rising across all social classes. That our healthcare and health would inexorably improve. That the UK would become ever cleaner and greener. That governance and democratic engagement would get better by the year.We could easily have had all of these things. A vast amount of money has flushed through this country. Science has advanced by leaps and bounds; health and labour-saving technologies have greatly improved; we know exactly how to build good homes, treat sewage and improve democracy.Instead (literally, in the case of our rivers) almost everything has gone to shit. The five giant evils identified in 1942 by William Beveridge, who helped design the welfare state, have returned with a vengeance. He called them “want, disease, ignorance, squalor and idleness”. His paternalistic language translates today into poverty, morbidity, educational exclusion, wretched housing and crumbling infrastructure, and bad employment or an inability to work.As they come thundering back, the five evil giants have brought some friends to the party: environmental chaos, extreme political dysfunction and misrule, impunity for the powerful and performative cruelty towards the powerless, and state-sponsored culture wars to distract us from the rest of the horror show.There is a reason for these broken promises and dysfunctions, which explains why the UK suffers more from them than most comparable nations. It’s called neoliberalism.Neoliberalism is an ideology that sees competition as our defining feature. It insists that our wellbeing is best realised not through political choice but through economic choice. What it calls “the market” will, if left to its own devices, determine who deserves to succeed and who does not. Everything that impedes the creation of this “natural order” of winners and losers – tax and the redistribution of wealth, welfare and public housing, publicly run and funded services, regulation, trade unions, protest, the power of politics itself – should, albeit often subtly and gradually, be shoved aside. It has dominated life in this country, to a degree unparalleled in similar nations, for 45 years.Yet it is seldom discussed in public, or even properly identified. When people on the left try to explain our predicament, they often use terms such as Thatcherism, austerity, laissez-faire economics, supply-side economics, neoclassical economics or libertarianism. All these terms are either inadequate, misleading or plain wrong. Neoliberalism is a distinct ideology, named by its leading thinkers in 1938. Its development was funded, from the 1940s onwards, by some of the richest people on Earth. They built its infrastructure of persuasion until, in the late 1970s, when Keynesianism ran into trouble, it could occupy the ideological vacuum.Neoliberalism is the means by which capital seeks to solve its biggest problem – a problem called democracy. Unlike laissez-faire economics or classical liberalism, which prevailed before most adults had the vote, neoliberalism uses the state in coherent and repeatable ways to impose its unpopular policies. The state is the force behind market forces, the whip enforcing “economic freedom”.Neoliberalism’s greatest triumph is to persuade us that, in Margaret Thatcher’s words, “there is no alternative”. In reality, the doctrine is an alternative to the much better lives we might have led. In the new book I’ve written with the film-maker Peter Hutchison, The Invisible Doctrine, we seek to drag this ideology and its disastrous impacts into the light and show how it can be overthrown to fulfil the promise of a better world.The doctrine reached its apogee in Liz Truss’s 49-day meltdown, when she tried to apply neoliberalism to the ideological letter. But this was just the most extreme manifestation of what we have suffered since 1979. Labour softened some aspects but accepted privatised public services, brutally curtailed protest, deregulated commerce even further and allowed the financial sector to pursue reckless get-rich-quick schemes. It added a disastrous twist of its own, extending the private finance initiative to vast tracts of government provision – one reason for the crises suffered by hospitals, schools, prisons and other services today.Amazingly, neoliberalism, despite all the breakdowns it has caused, continues to dominate. Labour, as the shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, demonstrates through her irrational commitment to austerity and her stated intention to deregulate capital even further, seems determined to ensure there is no alternative. Many in government believe it hasn’t gone far enough. This is what Truss and Mark Littlewood, chief engineer of her disaster, think (if thinking is the right word) and promote through their “Popular Conservatism” group, whose name will forever remain in quotes.Neoliberalism: the idea that swallowed the worldRead moreHow have successive governments got away with it? Through the endless promise of jam tomorrow. If we keep working harder, one day we’ll pay for the public services we need; one day we’ll earn the economic security we crave; one day we’ll have more leisure time. Will this magic day ever arrive? Of course not. Strong public services and economic security were never part of the plan. But to have us working ever-longer hours on behalf of capital? That is very much part of the plan.Interestingly, when environmentalists say we need to make sacrifices today to secure our future prosperity, the same government ministers insist that voters will never tolerate delayed gratification. In these and other ways, governance in the UK feels like one long trick played on the public.So they keep us hanging on. And the endless promises and the endless breaking of those promises grind us down. It would perhaps be more surprising if we found ourselves anywhere else on the mental health rankings.\n George Monbiot is a Guardian columnist.

{"headline": "Natalie Elphicke is a hard-right Tory. Her defection sums up Labour’s contempt for progressive voters ", "author": "Owen Jones", "teaser": "It was hailed as a triumph: it is anything but. It reveals a party that’s lost its moral compass", "published": "Wed 8 May 2024 18.52 CEST", "content": "Siri, show me a hollow victory.It is easy to imagine the glee felt by Keir Starmer’s advisers when Natalie Elphicke MP let them know she was minded to defect from the Tories to Labour. After all, nobody can accuse Dover’s parliamentary representative of being a Tory wet. If she hasn’t passed over your radar before, and you’re trying to place her politically, the better-known Jacob Rees-Mogg or Priti Patel would not be unfair comparisons. If Elphicke – Elphicke! – wants a spot in Labour’s tent, then nobody can accuse Starmer of harbouring some secret lefty agenda!Yes, the received wisdom would be that a political party welcoming defections from its chief rival has a strong hand. It shows the game is truly up for its opponents. It should, in fact, be seen as a weakness in a democracy, where the difference between two main political parties has become so narrow that its representatives can glide between the two. But even if you disagree with that, Elphicke’s defection is in a completely different category. This is a hard-right Tory MP who cut her teeth scaremongering about refugees and migrants.“When will The Left admit this is no refugee crisis … but simply illegal immigration,” was the headline of a Mail on Sunday article she penned in 2022. ‘‘Don’t trust Labour on immigration, they really want open borders, warns Natalie Elphicke,” said an article she wrote for the Daily Express only last year. Nobody serious should believe she has changed her views: she just no longer believes that Labour challenges this venom.When she was heckled by union members at a local protest in support of sacked P&amp;O staff, and was heckled for failing to vote against fire-and-rehire rules, she denounced “militant unionism”. She has generally voted against fewer obstacles for access to abortion. She was a member of the hard-right “Spartan” European Research GroupShe went for the English football icon Marcus Rashford over his campaign against child poverty, suggesting he should stick to football, despite having a second job herself. At the end of 2021, her local Labour party – which she has now joined – asked: “Is Ms Elpicke Kent’s worst MP?”Elphicke was also given a one-day suspension from parliament for trying to influence a judge presiding over the trial of her former husband, who was convicted of three counts of sexual assault. After his conviction, she claimed he’d merely been punished for being “attractive, and attracted to, women”. Remember this next time you hear Starmer trying to claim the mantle of integrity.Elphicke reportedly won’t be seeking re-election as a Labour MP, but let’s be clear about what today’s gesture means. Someone as rightwing as Elphicke would not be defecting to Labour if she seriously believed the party was committed to meaningful, progressive change. In her parting statement, she lauded Boris Johnson’s Conservative party for occupying the “centre ground”, suggesting that this is where Starmer has moved to. Elphicke, in other words, believes that Starmer is the true inheritor of the mantle of Johnson.Rachel Reeves is right: this government is gaslighting us over the economy | Polly ToynbeeRead moreWhat do you even say at this point? It has long been clear that Starmer led the most dishonest campaign for the leadership of a major political party in British history: he’s gone from promising a programme of nationalisation, tax hikes for the rich, scrapping tuition fees and lauding free movement, to welcoming a hardcore Tory MP into the fold. Thanks to the state of the Tory party, Starmer was already going to handsomely win a general election: none of this is necessary for him to enter No 10.Indeed Elphicke’s defection might be another harbinger of why it will all unravel for a Starmer premiership. Starmerism is a political project devoid of principle or, indeed, a soul. Many who have worked with him up-close have observed how little politics he seems to have. He has compensated for that by surrounding himself with what the Labour MP and former Tony Blair adviser Jon Cruddas described as “the most rightwing, illiberal faction in the party”. Trashing his signature £28bn a year green investment fund, and now reportedly watering down the last distinctive policy package still standing – workers’ rights – points in one direction only: a new government which will have no answers to the multiple crises afflicting British society. With no political core, a Starmer premiership will be buffeted by events. Voters who – not unreasonably – expect change after the Tories have been booted will soon ask: where is it?In the recent local elections, Green and leftwing independent candidates surged, capitalising on discontent with Starmerism. That’s before Starmer is even prime minister and had the opportunity to alienate voters in power – and it’s in the context of the country understandably desperately wanting the Tories out.

{"headline": "I’ve seen how firms cheat the law to exploit workers and here’s a warning: those days are ending", "author": "Polly Toynbee", "teaser": "For all the controversy about Labour’s policy on ‘workers’ rights’, it looks set to be a gamechanger", "published": "Tue 14 May 2024 09.00 CEST", "content": "How did Labour let its most life-transforming policy get more publicity for its suspected “watering down” than it ever got for the policy itself? Today, Keir Starmer and Angela Rayner will meet the unions to assure them the new deal for working people is as radical as ever: an agreed, detailed policy document follows soon. The Trades Union Congress, broadly supportive, is watching carefully for any weakening of the deal, while this year’s TUC president, the Fire Brigades Union’s Matt Wrack, sends out warning shots against backsliding.Speaking to the shopworkers’ union Usdaw last month, Starmer was adamant that he would not back down. And to business leaders recently he said that “to be crystal clear”, Labour would “level up workers’ rights in a way that has not been attempted for decades”, though he recognised “that might not please everyone in the room or the wider business community”. This is core to Labour’s purpose and to igniting growth. Only Unite’s Sharon Graham publicly claims “betrayal”, as she often does. But in private today, all unions will want cast-iron reassurance.They do need to scrutinise every word to block loopholes. These rights best help the weak and voiceless – the one in nine workers in insecure jobs who are prone to exploitation. I saw how employers cheat the law when researching my book Hard Work. I took a job as a porter advertised in the job centre, not for some rogue outfit but for a hospital. As most public sector manual work has been outsourced, ever since Margaret Thatcher’s orders, I was not working for the NHS, but for an agency supplying the main contractor, providing portering and cleaning.After queueing for hours in a jam-packed office behind a shabby shopfront, applicants were handed forms to sign. We couldn’t take them away to study their minuscule fine-print, so I took notes. The casual worker agreement was an “agreement to provide occasional services” – otherwise known as a zero-hours contract. In a key clause, I opted out of the 48-hour maximum working week, a legal “voluntary” waiver: “The temporary worker hereby agrees that the working week limit shall not apply.”All flexibility around working too many or too few hours belonged to the agency. Other clauses read: “as a casual worker you will not be subject to the company’s grievance and disciplinary procedures” and “uniform costs will be deducted from the following week’s pay”. The legal four weeks’ holiday would apply after 13 weeks of continuous service; agencies tend to fire and rehire after 12 weeks. Voluntary? No signature, no job.That’s the squalid, exploitative world Labour would abolish. But employment law is fiendishly complex because work covers multitudinous occupations and situations. Examine the working time regulations’ exemptions for sea fishing, civil protection, the armed forces, police and so on to see why some of the broad principles outlined in Labour’s original green paper were bound to be refined. Done right, that’s not necessarily “watering down”. After much negotiation with the unions, these changes were agreed (except by Unite, which abstained) at Labour’s national policy forum this January. One difficulty: zero-hours contracts suit some workers, so Labour’s new offer gives them day-one rights and after 12 weeks a contract for minimum hours actually worked.However, the law hardly matters if enforcement is reduced to rubble. Labour will merge and boost ineffective regulators, so every employee knows the number to call. The UN’s International Labour Organization, to which the UK is a signatory, requires one inspector for 10,000 employees: the UK is 1,797 short, and bad employers know it. Labour’s fair pay agreements, drawn up with business and unions, would enforce pay and conditions across an entire industry, starting with social care. Winston Churchill in 1909 created wages councils for minimum pay across sectors from agricultural work to hat-making: Thatcher and John Major abolished them.Labour’s ‘new deal for workers’ will not fully ban zero-hours contractsRead moreThe first ever law forcing all employers to admit union recruiters will be a gamechanger, letting union reps into every “fulfilment centre”, fast-food restaurant, care home and care agency, pizza delivery company and delivery depot. Trade union membership raises average pay and prevents employer skulduggery. The fall in union membership helped cause the great 1980s decline in pay. But recruitment is now near-impossible in such places, relying on union reps leafletting outside workplaces at shift change, as people hurry home to children or to a second job.To organise freely without fear of employers picking on joiners, sacking them or denying them extra hours will send membership soaring: there were more than 12 million union members in 1980, but only 6.25 million in 2022. Restoring union rights will remove recent anti-strike laws: Labour has just added easier union recognition rules and electronic balloting. It will stop planned new employment tribunal fees, which – along with tribunal backlogs a year long – deter the low-paid from making claims.These rights get overwhelming support from the public, and from most managers: a level playing field prevents undercutting by rogue companies. Chartered Management Institute polling finds 80% of managers want workers’ rights prioritised, and 83% think better working rights raise productivity.Making this policy work is key to Labour’s growth plan, as the TUC rightly says: “The UK’s long experiment with a low-rights, low-wage economy is a complete failure.” Where’s the payoff for all these Tory years of deregulation, anti-union laws, public sector pay cuts in real terms and rising inequality? Productivity grew by just 0.4% a year in the 12 years after the financial crisis. That’s half the rate of the 25 richest OECD countries, says the Resolution Foundation. The Marmot review shows bad working lives lead to worse physical and mental health, absence due to illness and worklessness raising disability costs.The Tories dithered on the “watering down” story, from viewing it as another Labour flip-flop to labelling it as Labour obeying its union “paymasters” and saying the plans would pile “70 new burdens on employers”. Business has been mostly quiescent, asking for clarification to prevent “unintended consequences”. But that in itself raises suspicions among some Labour people too quick to believe any “backsliding” story, ever since soaring inflation and borrowing costs forced a retreat on the £28bn green investment deal until later in parliament. Natalie Elphicke’s bizarre arrival in their ranks only confirmed those expecting nothing but disappointment, spying Peter Mandelson’s hand everywhere. (My guess is he’s actually miffed at being left out, hence his snidery about Starmer’s weight.)Employment law is a thicket where every detail matters. Today’s meeting, and the final policy paper shortly to come, need a resounding reaffirmation from Labour and the unions that well-designed rights, made law in the first 100 days of a Labour government, will mark a seismic shift in power from employer to employee, with rising union membership and rising wages.\n Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist\nExplore more on these topicsEmployment lawOpinionLabourConservativescommentShareReuse this content", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/may/14/workers-rights-labour-policy"},

That’s what today’s speech was about", "published": "Mon 13 May 2024 15.40 CEST", "content": "Rishi Sunak is talking rubbish to win votes. He warns today that the next few years will be among the most terrifying and “transformative” the country has ever known. Britain faces the “most dangerous threat” to its security from “colluding authoritarian states” since the end of the cold war.Such threats are politics at its cheapest. Every war indulged in by Britain over the past 30 years has been self-willed and aggressive, not defensive, waged against overseas sovereign states. There may have been reasons for such aggressions, but they have had nothing to do with defence, except arguably in the Falklands. The last real threat to Britain’s territorial integrity was from Hitler in 1940-41. Since then, collective European security against a supposedly aggressive Russia certainly allowed western Europe to prosper, and Britain to gain from that prosperity. But Russia’s military threat was, as it always has been, to its immediate neighbours. There are many other “threats” to Britain – commercial, migratory and electronic – but they are not military.When forced against a wall, British leaders have always slid into shielding their belligerence behind a veil of “values”. A post-imperial rhetoric has allowed every global conflict to be somehow Britain’s concern. Some have been humanitarian, as in Kosovo, Lebanon and possibly Ukraine. Most have been grasps at political glory, from Cyprus and Suez to Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya. Almost all have cost billions, killed tens of thousands and ended in defeat. It is hard to see any that advanced the cause of British values.Sunak now declares that the UK must face up “to an axis of authoritarian states” – China, Russia, North Korea and Iran – if it is to “succeed in the years to come”. He demands that these countries not be allowed “to undermine our shared values and identities”. But they are not seeking to do that. He does not have the power to stop them, nor are they anything to do with Britain’s defence. In reality, Sunak’s intention has been simply to taunt Labour for not promising at once to raise defence spending to an arbitrary 2.5% of national income – which he too has failed to do.By all means let us preach, teach and trade, but this half-hearted British interventionism – “punching above our weight on the world stage” to Boris Johnson – has wasted billions over the years on posturing, on glamorous ships, tanks and planes. Yet Britain cannot even afford an Iron Dome defence system to protect against drone attack, as used in Israel and Ukraine.The collusion of authoritarian states which Sunak so fears has been strengthened by Nato’s counterproductive economic sanctions against Russia. As was predicted, sanctions have strengthened economic ties between Russia, China, India and Iran. Fostered by the fatuous thesis that they would bring about the downfall of Vladimir Putin, they have instead hurt western economies and eroded support for Kyiv.No credible European leader would seek to scare their people by threatening them that the next few years will be “the most dangerous yet”. They would not call on them to pay higher taxes and sacrifice public services to impose their values on the rest of the world. They would see their job as to uphold those values at home, period.

{"headline": "The students protesting in Dublin are on the right side of history – and they know it", "author": "Owen Jones", "teaser": "With their success in persuading their university to divest from Israeli companies, they join a rich tradition of student activists ", "published": "Fri 10 May 2024 13.29 CEST", "content": "Who tends to get the big foreign policy calls right: student protesters, or their detractors? Answering this question, it turns out, is useful if you don’t want to end up judged poorly by history. Student protesters were vilified when they stood against the Vietnam war, yet now, who would have wanted to be on the side that denigrated them variously as naive, dupes and extremists? How should we look back at the students suspended after walking out of lessons in protest at the impending war in Iraq in 2003? Today we might say they come off looking pretty good, having had far more foresight than the seasoned politicians and ageing media commentators who cheered that particular cataclysm on back then.That legacy loomed large on Wednesday in a courtyard at Trinity College Dublin, filled with students waving Palestinian flags alongside the Irish tricolour, as the triumphant student union president, László Molnárfi, told them their protests would succeed in Ireland, the US and across the world “because our cause is right”. The students were jubilant, because they had won.Before the encampment was set up (similar to those at Columbia University in New York and UCLA in California, which have faced a brutal onslaught from police and pro-Israel activists), the university authorities were in no mood to concede to student demands. Within days, management U-turned, promising Trinity would divest from Israeli companies, some of which are linked to Israel’s illegal settlements in the West Bank. A group of lecturers from Academics for Palestine beamed with pride. “It’s weird to win!” one told me. “How strange a feeling it is, to not make excuses and explanations for a loss.”Perhaps because of its centuries-long violent subjugation by the British, Ireland is more fertile territory for sympathies for the Palestinian cause than most western states. A poll earlier this year found more than seven in 10 Irish voters believe Israel is subjecting Palestinians to apartheid, and the country’s new centre-right prime minister, Simon Harris, drawing on Ireland’s own history of famine, delivered a message to Israel’s Benjamin Netanyahu on behalf of the Irish people: “We are repulsed by your actions.”But in truth, student protesters against Israel’s unfolding genocide in Gaza seem to enjoy far more public sympathy now – and far more quickly – than their Vietnam equivalents. Indeed, back then, protesters were a minority on campus, let alone in wider society. In 1967, 49% of US college students backed escalation in Vietnam, with just 35% opting for de-escalation. A couple of years later, college students were more likely to express opposition to the Republican president Richard Nixon’s Vietnam policies than the wider public, but nonetheless, more approved than not. When Joe Biden reported that at the time he had believed student protesters were “assholes”, he was merely reflecting what was once widespread public opinion. By October 1970, a large majority of Americans believed campus unrest was caused by “radical militant student groups”, “irresponsible” troublemakers, and “radical professors” encouraging revolt.View image in fullscreenStudents and demonstrators protesting against the Vietnam war at Columbia University in New York, 1968. Photograph: John Duricka/APThere are crucial differences here. While US weapons transfers alongside aid and diplomatic support have led the former Palestinian negotiator Diana Buttu to describe Gaza as an “Israeli-American war”, US soldiers aren’t fighting and dying on the ground. Just over 2.7 million Americans served in Vietnam, of whom more than 58,000 perished and more than 300,000 were wounded.That galvanised the student movement, but it was also manipulated by pro-war figures. There were student deferments and exemptions from combat, with well-connected, privileged college students able to gain admission to non-combat military service such as the National Guard. Poorer Americans were more likely to be slaughtered in Vietnam’s killing fields. Students were easily caricatured as pampered brats insulting the sacrifice of their working-class peers. This smear campaign proved devastatingly successful, and in May 1970, hundreds of US construction workers violently assaulted peace protesters in New York City, chanting “All the way, USA”, in the so-called Hard Hat riot.It’s true that Americans are more opposed than not to today’s student protests, but without the entrenched bitter hostility that defined the backlash against the Vietnam peace movement, and with those under 45 more sympathetic than not. That more Americans believe Israel is committing genocide than those who don’t – including an overwhelming majority of Democrats – points to a major difference between now and the years-long military quagmire of Vietnam in the 1970s.Indeed, it is generally the fate of protesters to be patronised and demonised in their time. The most notorious example is of course the suffragettes, who are today virtually secular saints, but who were widely denounced as dangerous subversives and terrorists in the early 1900s. Student protesters in particular are often victims of what could be described as “the eyeroll”: a condescending dismissal of the young as naive know-it-alls who need to be educated in the ways of the world before they are qualified to arrive at such assured conclusions.Yet the confidence I saw in the grounds of Trinity College Dublin came from history. They are well aware of how previous generations of student protesters were treated, and how their causes came to be judged. A grave and obvious evil such as Gaza is not going to be an exception: it is likely to be the most hideous vindication yet.\n Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist\n Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

{"headline": "Starmer may be bland – but that passes the taste test in a country sick of spicy politics", "author": "Rafael Behr", "teaser": "Activists doubt Labour’s cautious strategy, but many voters are looking for a ‘Weetabix candidate’ – reassuring and uncontroversial", "published": "Wed 8 May 2024 07.00 CEST", "content": "Amid the cacophony of post-election analysis over the weekend, one item struck me as especially bleak for Rishi Sunak. It wasn’t the byelection defeat or the seismic swing away from the Tories. It wasn’t even in a news programme. It was an advert.“Britain hasn’t been so great of late,” says a pastiche scientist. “Economical, societal and sporting performance has dropped.” The reason: not enough Weetabix.Why is this so bad for Sunak? Breakfast habits do not dictate national wellbeing. But consumer brands strive for political neutrality for fear of alienating customers. Weetabix wouldn’t run a marketing campaign claiming Britain feels down in the dumps if that were a provocative assertion. But it is uncontroversial. And if it barely even counts as a political statement to say the country feels rubbish, the government presiding over the slump is in serious trouble.The Weetabix index is supported by opinion polls. In a recent survey by More in Common, a civil society organisation, voters were asked to describe the UK in a word. The top choices were “broken”, “mess”, “struggling”, “divided”, “expensive”, “poor” and “chaotic”.Labour is shrewdly exploiting the mood. The party has launched a digital campaign based on a spoof streaming service, Conflix, showcasing episodes of scandal and incompetence. A general election is pitched as the season finale – a chance to end “14 long years” of Tory “chaos and decline”.It is effective because the premise is secure. The gloom is common to voters from different parts of the country and very different backgrounds. That means they also might have incompatible views on what needs to be done differently. Pessimism is good for dissolving incumbent power, but not great as an adhesive, binding people to any replacement government. In the gaps where enthusiasm for Labour is hard to discern, the Tories forage for solace.The prime minister has seized on one polling device that extrapolates last week’s results into national vote shares (Labour 35%; Tories 26%) and feeds those numbers into a hypothetical general election. The outcome is a hung parliament.It could happen, although the model inflates the likelihood by ignoring Scotland and assuming that Liberal Democrats and Greens will do as well in a national ballot as they do in local contests. Even if smaller parties surge at a general election, most of the energy will be tactically directed to inflict maximum harm on the Tories.View image in fullscreen‘Weetabix wouldn’t run a marketing campaign claiming Britain feels down in the dumps if that were a provocative assertion.’ Photograph: John Stillwell/PALabour is winning big on a relatively humble vote-share percentage by knowing exactly where it needs the biggest swings, and who will turn out on the day. There are many subplots in last week’s results, but the big story was a tale of Keir Starmer’s method working. More precisely, it was a vindication of the strategic focus brought by Morgan McSweeney and Pat McFadden, the campaign director and coordinator respectively.The centrality of data-heavy vote-mining to Starmer’s operation is often cited by critics as a symptom of shallowness. The charge is that Labour is bundling an insipid leader over the line with a flimsily stitched electoral coalition that will unravel as soon as it snags on the sharp end of government.That analysis gets traction because it comes from two angles. It is a comfort for Tories who want to believe they will get back in the game quickly post-defeat. And it is the lament of a disgruntled left that sees itself as the custodian of the Labour soul, resents its marginalisation by Starmer and presumes that any victory bought at a Faustian price must be followed by damnation.The crucial item of polling evidence in belittling Labour’s prospects is the opposition leader’s lacklustre personal ratings. Starmer is nowhere near as popular as Tony Blair was on the eve of his 1997 landslide victory, nor even as well-liked as David Cameron in 2010, and he failed to secure an outright majority. Britain might be poised for regime change, but it won’t come in a surge of Starmermania.Comparison with past candidacies has limited value. When a long-serving prime minister leaves a lasting impression on the country, hindsight bias projects that influence further back than it actually goes. Britain was not a very Thatcherite place before 1979. Definitions of Blairism, whether positive or pejorative, are derived from choices made in government, not opposition.The test for the current Labour leader isn’t whether he is more charismatic than spirits of politics past, but whether he is preferred by present-day voters to his nearest rival. He passes that test, and the Tories, in denial of the real causes of their unpopularity, might choose someone even less electable than Sunak as his successor.Leaders in bygone contests also set an impossibly high bar. Public esteem for politics is lower than it was when Blair and Cameron were in their pomp. Allegiance is more commonly set by negative partisanship – voting to obstruct the most disliked candidate.For many Tories, Boris Johnson is the exemplar of a high-charisma candidate whose 2019 triumph expressed public affection. In reality, he went into that contest with approval ratings lower than Theresa May had in 2017, just before she threw away a majority. Johnson owed his victory more to impatience with Brexit stalemate and aversion to Jeremy Corbyn than any talismanic “Boris effect”. His subsequent downfall was from a lower ledge than his cheerleaders recall. It also helped discredit cavalier showmanship as a mode of government.In a disillusioned political climate where big pledges are disbelieved and grand visions are discounted, Starmer’s lack of pizzazz could even be an asset. If the national mood is defined by fatigue and mistrust of glib gimmicks, there is space for a leader who embodies dogged ordinariness – politics without the hectoring hard sell.Starmer’s critics lament the modesty of his ambition, but the portion size of his promises is set by a shrunken public appetite. “He’s boring,” one former Conservative voter, now undecided, recently said of the opposition leader in a focus group. “But maybe boring is what we need right now.” It is a familiar refrain.The winning coalition that Labour is assembling might be disparate and ideologically incoherent, but in collective readiness for dull government without the cacophony and chaos, Britain is more Starmerite than it is anything else right now.Impatience for radical upheaval and a taste for soaring rhetoric are markers of activist-level engagement in politics. That is a niche audience. It underestimates the appeal of a blandly wholesome candidate, and it would be a mistake to market Starmer as anything else. If he were a breakfast cereal, he probably would be Weetabix.

I don’t mean we’re not getting the facts about what’s happening in Manhattan superior court. But something very big is being left out.The trial has introduced us to a world of moral and ethical loathsomeness in which people use and abuse one another routinely. It’s Trump world.Consider Stormy Daniels. Adult film stars are entitled to do as they wish to make money. But when they extort people who are running for public office – demanding huge payments in order to stay quiet about an affair – they’re contributing to a society in which every interaction has a potential price.Trump’s hush-money case has proven he’s a low-life. Can it prove he’s a criminal? | Margaret SullivanRead moreLast week we heard Daniels’s story, even more detailed and lascivious than expected. But perhaps the most troubling aspect of her behavior is that the moment the former president ran for office, she saw a chance to extort money from him. She then “shopped” her account of their sexual liaison before finally accepting $130,000 to be silenced in the 2016 election’s final, critical days.Or consider Michael Cohen. Powerful people often need “fixers” – assistants that carry out their wishes and protect them from legal or political trouble. But when those fixers arrange payments to keep stories out of the media, they’re treading on morally thin ice.Cohen didn’t just fix. He boasted of burying Trump’s secrets and spreading Trump’s lies. In his work for Trump, he repeatedly acted illegally and found ways to cover up his actions. After he paid Daniels to keep silent and Trump was elected president, Cohen concocted with Trump a means of being reimbursed that involved falsifying records that disguised the repayment as ordinary legal expenses, according to his testimony.And then there’s David Pecker, publisher of the National Enquirer. Tabloids are part of a long tradition of US journalism. But when tabloid publishers buy stories to bury them on behalf of powerful people, thereby establishing a kind of bankable account of chits that can be cashed in with the powerful, it violates public morality because it corrupts our democracy.Two weeks ago, Pecker testified about “catching and killing” stories – buying the exclusive rights to stories, or “catching them”, for the specific goal of ensuring the information never becomes public. That’s the “killing” part. According to people who have worked for him, Pecker mastered this technique – ethics be damned.Which brings us to Trump himself. I don’t care that he had extramarital affairs. But when a presidential candidate tells his fixer to buy off someone – “just take care of it” – so the public doesn’t get information about a candidate before an election that they might find relevant to evaluating him, it undermines democracy.This cast of characters – and there are many, many others like them in Trump world – are loathsome not only because they may have violated the law, but because they have contributed to a harsh society in which everyone is potentially bought or sold.The people who inhabit Trumpworld live in a more extreme place, where there are no norms, no standards of decencyIt’s a sell-or-tell society, a catch-and-kill society, a just-take-care-of-it society. A society where money and power are the only considerations. Where honor and integrity count for nothing.I am not naive about how the world works. I’ve spent years in Washington, many of them around powerful people. I have seen the seamy side of US politics and business.But the people who inhabit Trump world live in a more extreme place, where there are no norms, no standards of decency, no common good. There are only opportunities to make money and the dangers of being ripped off. It’s a place where there are no relationships, only transactions.I sometimes worry that the daily dismal drone of Trump world – the continuous lies and vindictiveness that issue from Trump and his campaign, the dismissive and derogatory ways he deals with and talks about others, the people who testify at his criminal trial about what they have done for him and what he has done for or to them – has a subtly corrosive effect on our own world.I think it is important to remind ourselves that most of the people we know are not like this. That honor and integrity do count. That standards of decency guide most behavior. That relationships matter.\n Robert Reich, a former US secretary of labor, is a professor of public policy at the University of California, Berkeley, and the author of Saving Capitalism: For the Many, Not the Few and The Common Good.

{"headline": "What’s up with ChatGPT’s new sexy persona?", "author": "Arwa Mahdawi", "teaser": "OpenAI’s updated chatbot GPT-4o is weirdly flirtatious, coquettish and sounds like Scarlett Johansson in Her. Why?", "published": "Thu 16 May 2024 12.15 CEST", "content": "“Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic,” Arthur C Clarke famously said. And this could certainly be said of the impressive OpenAI update to ChatGPT, called GPT-4o, which was released on Monday. With the slight caveat that it felt a lot like the magician was a horny 12-year-old boy who had just watched the Spike Jonze movie Her.If you aren’t up to speed on GPT-4o (the o stands for “omni”) it’s basically an all-singing, all-dancing, all-seeing version of the original chatbot. You can now interact with it the same way you’d interact with a human, rather than via text-based questions. It can give you advice, it can rate your jokes, it can describe your surroundings, it can banter with you. It sounds human. “It feels like AI from the movies,” OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in a blog post on Monday. “Getting to human-level response times and expressiveness turns out to be a big change.”It hasn’t gone unnoticed that when Altman says “AI from the movies”, he seems to be referring to the 2013 movie Her, which featured a lonely writer falling in love with an operating system (voiced by Scarlett Johansson) designed to meet his every need. In many of the demonstrations, the bot’s voice sounds a lot like Johansson. And after the OpenAI event on Monday, Altman tweeted with a single word: “her”.There’s nothing wrong with giving your chatbot a voice like Johansson in Her. What does feel a little weird, however, is making your chatbot weirdly flirtatious and coquettish. While the chatbot has a male voice in some of the demo videos (namely the one in which it helps a new dad practice dad jokes), a number of the demo videos, including one where she helps someone with interview prep, feature the Johansson-like voice sounding oddly seductive.“Am I the only one that gets the ick from how flirty this is?” technologist Nick St Pierre asked on Twitter/X, linking to the interview prep videos. Judging by the responses to his tweet, he wasn’t.While GPT-4o’s flirtatiousness was glossed over by a lot of male-authored articles about the release, Parmy Olson addressed it head-on in a piece for Bloomberg headlined Making ChatGPT ‘Sexy’ Might Not End Well for Humans.“What are the social and psychological consequences of regularly speaking to a flirty, fun and ultimately agreeable artificial voice on your phone, and then encountering a very different dynamic with men and women in real life?” Olson asks.These voice assistants don’t just send a signal about gender norms, they send it at massive scaleOpenAI didn’t get back to Olson when she posed them that question. But they didn’t need to. We don’t have to hypothesize about the consequences of giving GPT-4o the ability to sound like a submissive young woman who caters to your every need because there’s already a ton of data on this. We’ve been having conversations about the social impact of female-sounding voice assistants like Apple’s Siri and Amazon’s Alexa for a very long time now.In 2018, for example, USC sociology professor Safiya Umoja Noble warned that the gender of assistants’ voices affects how we speak to them. Noble told New York Magazine that virtual assistants have produced a “rise of command-based speech at women’s voices. ‘Siri, find me [fill in the blank]’ is something that children, for example, may learn to do as they play with smart devices. This is a powerful socialization tool that teaches us about the role of women, girls, and people who are gendered female to respond on demand.”A highly influential 2019 Unesco report echoed Noble’s warning. “Because the speech of most voice assistants is female, it sends a signal that women are obliging, docile and eager-to-please helpers, available at the touch of a button or with a blunt voice command like ‘hey’ or ‘OK’,” the report said.What’s crucial to note here is that these voice assistants don’t just send a signal about gender norms, they send it at massive scale. The Unesco report explains, for example, that Apple’s Siri “made ‘her’ debut not as a genderless robot, but as a sassy young woman who deflected insults and liked to flirt and serve users with playful obedience … This technology was a flagship feature in the nearly 150m iPhones Apple sold from late 2011 and through 2012. This singular technology – developed behind closed doors by one company in one state in one country, with little input from women – shaped global expectations of what an AI assistant is and should be, in a mere 15 months.” And, indeed, you can draw a direct line from Siri’s personality to flirty GPT-4o.That 2019 Unesco report came with a call-to-action. “The world needs to pay much closer attention to how, when and whether AI technologies are gendered and, crucially, who is gendering them,” Saniye Gülser Corat, Unesco’s director for gender equality, said.Laughing, chatting, singing, GPT-4o is AI close to human, but watch out: it’s really not human | Chris Stokel-WalkerRead moreBig tech has paid some lip service to this and has started offering more masculine voice options with their voice assistants. Still, the new and improved ‘sexy’ version of ChatGPT seems to make it clear that nobody at OpenAI seems particularly interested in paying attention to how AI technologies are gendered and the ramifications of this. This might be because it’s a male-dominated company which didn’t have a single woman on its board for a few months. (They appointed three women board members in March.) It might be because they have board members like Larry Summers: the economist and former Harvard president who, in 2005, famously downplayed discrimination and suggested that men outperform women in maths and sciences because of biological difference. (He later apologized.) Or it might just be because they can’t be bothered to think about things like gender; it simply doesn’t interest them.For all the ooh-ing and ahh-ing about how innovative ChatGPT is and how it’s going to change the world, it feels like nothing has changed when it comes to misogyny in tech. It’s frustrating that we are still having the same conversations about bias in digital technology that we’ve been having for more than a decade. It’s infuriating that some of the highest-paid people in the world, people who are regularly lauded as the greatest minds of their generation, are still seemingly oblivious to gender norms and their roles in perpetuating them. We’re constantly being told that OpenAI is building the future, but I don’t really know whether a sexy ChatGPT is progress.Explore more on these topicsChatGPTOpinionOpenAIArtificial intelligence (AI)HercommentShareReuse this content", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/may/16/openai-chatgpt-sexy-persona"},

In 2010, there were two cases involving psychiatric suffering; in 2023, there were 138: 1.5% of the 9,068 euthanasia deaths.An article about her case, published in April, was picked up by international media, prompting an outcry that caused Ter Beek huge distress.She said it was understandable that cases such as hers – and the broader issue of whether assisted dying should be legal – were controversial. “People think that when you’re mentally ill, you can’t think straight, which is insulting,” she told the Guardian. “I understand the fears that some disabled people have about assisted dying, and worries about people being under pressure to die.“But in the Netherlands, we’ve had this law for more than 20 years. There are really strict rules, and it’s really safe.”Under Dutch law, to be eligible for an assisted death, a person must be experiencing “unbearable suffering with no prospect of improvement”. They must be fully informed and competent to take such a decision.View image in fullscreenTer Beek’s chronic mental health conditions have affected her since childhood. Photograph: Ilvy NjiokiktjienTer Beek’s difficulties began in early childhood. She has chronic depression, anxiety, trauma and unspecified personality disorder. She has also been diagnosed with autism. When she met her partner, she thought the safe environment he offered would heal her. “But I continued to self-harm and feel suicidal.”She embarked on intensive treatments, including talking therapies, medication and more than 30 sessions of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). “In therapy, I learned a lot about myself and coping mechanisms, but it didn’t fix the main issues. At the beginning of treatment, you start out hopeful. I thought I’d get better. But the longer the treatment goes on, you start losing hope.”After 10 years, there was “nothing left” in terms of treatment. “I knew I couldn’t cope with the way I live now.” She had thought about taking her own life but the violent death by suicide of a schoolfriend and its impact on the girl’s family deterred her.“I finished ECT in August 2020, and after a period of accepting there was no more treatment, I applied for assisted dying in December that year. It’s a long and complicated process. It’s not like you ask for assisted dying on a Monday and you’re dead by Friday.‘We need to talk about choice’: woman who ended life at Dignitas urges change to UK lawRead more“I was on a waiting list for assessment for a long time, because there are so few doctors willing to be involved in assisted dying for people with mental suffering. Then you have to be assessed by a team, have a second opinion about your eligibility, and their decision has to be reviewed by another independent doctor.“In the three and a half years this has taken, I’ve never hesitated about my decision. I have felt guilt – I have a partner, family, friends and I’m not blind to their pain. And I’ve felt scared.

You can stop at any point.’ My partner has been in the room for most conversations in order to support me, but several times he has been asked to leave so the doctors can be sure I’m speaking freely.”When the article about her case – which Ter Beek said had many inaccuracies and misrepresentations – was published in April, her inbox “exploded”.

For me, it will be like falling asleep. My partner will be there, but I’ve told him it’s OK if he needs to leave the room before the moment of death,” she said.“Now the point has come, we’re ready for it and we’re finding a certain peace.

{"headline": "How Russia has advanced in Kharkiv despite warnings attack was coming", "author": "Dan Sabbagh", "teaser": "Shortage of munitions, fighters and air defences leaves Ukraine unprepared to repel attack", "published": "Thu 16 May 2024 12.02 CEST", "content": "Russia’s attack across the border north and north-west of Kharkiv was telegraphed by Moscow, predicted by western intelligence and anticipated by Ukraine. The fact that Russian forces have been able to advance about 4 miles at multiple points in five days raises serious questions about Kyiv’s ability to defend itself.An intention to create “a sanitary zone” along the border inside Ukraine was signalled by Vladimir Putin in March. A month later Sergei Lavrov, the foreign minister, highlighted that Kharkiv had an “important role” in such a strategy as the region was reeling from bombing that had knocked out two power stations on 22 March.At the same time, Moscow’s military had been building up its new Northern Group of forces, estimated by the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) at 30,000 strong, in Russia’s Belgorod region. Last week, two days before the dawn assault, Kharkiv’s regional governor said a massing of forces had been spotted.A warning was also passed, one source added, from UK defence intelligence to Ukraine’s leadership. So when on 5am last Friday, somewhere between 5,000 and 10,000 Russian soldiers crossed the border at two key points, it might have been expected that the attack would be swiftly repulsed.View image in fullscreenUkrainian servicemen of the 92nd Assault Brigade fire a multiple rocket launcher towards Russian positions, in the Kharkiv region, on 15 May. Photograph: Roman Pilipey/AFP/Getty ImagesIn fact, Ukraine’s defensive lines were thin to absent. At Vovchansk, less than 40 miles north-west of Kharkiv, “the first line of fortifications and mines just didn’t exist”, wrote Ukrainian commander Denys Yaroslavsky on Sunday, while a Ukrainian veteran with contacts in region said “units were simply not prepared to fight” and defences “not properly positioned”.By the middle of the week fighting had reached Vovchansk and villages north of Lyptsi, about 20 miles away from Ukraine’s second city, home to 1.3 million people. A near-term goal would be for the invaders to reach the range of Russian 152mm artillery, about 15 miles, from which it would be possible to resume shelling of parts of the city, last in gun range in September 2022.MapsThe rapid reversal in an area previously considered quiet is the latest setback for Ukraine in 2024. So far this year Russia has continued to increase the size of its invasion force, to 510,000, and exploited the defenders’ air defence and munitions shortages to capture Avdiivka in February and seize a bridgehead north west of it in April. In May it began to menace Kharkiv region with the hope of frightening the population to move.Since March, as identified by Maria Avdeeva, a Ukrainian security expert, Russia has been engaged in a steady stream of online propaganda aimed at unsettling Kharkiv city and region residents. Postings from pro-Russian Telegram channels told residents of Kharkiv oblast (and neighbouring Sumy) in April “to prepare for combat operations in the built-up areas” and messages circulated of fake evacuation plans encouraging city residents to flee west and south.Ukraine’s military difficulties have been caused in part by the four-month pause in weapon supplies from the US – finally resolved last month when a $61bn aid package passed Congress – and European countries’ struggle to ramp up arms manufacturing before late 2024. At the same time, Ukraine, outnumbered on the battlefield, is struggling to conscript men, and has reduced the minimum age from 27 to 25.View image in fullscreenAn elderly woman is evacuated from Vovchansk city on 15 May amid Russian advances. In May, Russia began to menace Kharkiv region with the hope of frightening the population to move. Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesShortfalls in Ukrainian artillery and an absence of defences against ballistic missiles and long-range glide bombs have been well observed in recent weeks. But Jack Watling, a land warfare expert at the Royal United Services Institute thinktank, said Russia was also overcoming the limitations of its undertrained army and beginning “to compound its advantages” with munitions.Such is the diminishment of Ukraine’s frontline surface-to-air missile defences, that they are focused on deterring Russian jets from crossing the frontlines. But they are no longer able to knock out Orlan-10 reconnaissance drones, which are now “routinely flying over both Kharkiv and Zaporizhzhia”, Watling said in a new paper and more “accurately detect and destroy targets behind the frontlines”.Russia has been bombing Kharkiv city since the end of March with air-launched glide bombs. In the latest attack on Tuesday, the Kharkiv oblast governor, Oleh Syniehubov, said four people were injured after bombs struck the north of the city. Later the same day, the president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, anxiously asked Antony Blinken, the US secretary of state, for two $1bn Patriot air defence batteries to help defend the Kharkiv region.View image in fullscreenA damaged high-rise building after a Russian missile attack on 14 May in Kharkiv, Ukraine. Photograph: Global Images Ukraine/Getty ImagesMilitary analysts stress there are explanations for why Ukraine has been forced back. The area occupied is lightly populated grey zone that was especially hard to defend because Ukraine is banned from using US weapons to strike targets in Russia itself.“It’s suicidal for Ukraine to have its main line of defence on the border, where the Russians can hit you with artillery and glide bombs and the Ukrainians don’t have weapons available like Himars rocket artillery to hit back because of US restrictions,” said George Barros, an analyst with the ISW. As a result, Russian forces can mass across the border in a relatively safe space.The analyst argued that Ukraine “has to defend a tremendous amount of territory, but is struggling with manpower issues” – meaning they do not have the capability to create Russian style fortifications along the entire northern frontier. In the aftermath of the Kharkiv incursion, Brig Gen Oleksandr Yakovets emphasised that better fortifications were prepared in the second line, “15-17km from the frontline” and in the third up to 35km deep.So far, the forces that Russia has committed to Kharkiv, up to 30,000 from Belgorod, rising to 50,000 if nearby forces are included, are nowhere near enough to threaten a city the size of Kharkiv, Barros said.The battle is not a territorial struggle for Ukraine’s second city, but more likely a combination of a diversionary attack to weaken defensive lines in the Donbas and an attempt to use bombardment to turn Kharkiv into a ghost town.Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaanalysisShareReuse this content", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/may/16/ukraines-defences-thin-on-ground-as-russia-advances-on-kharkiv"},
{"headline": "How the world could have looked: the most spectacular buildings that were never made", "author": "Oliver Wainwright", "teaser": "A mega egg in Paris, a hovering hotel in Machu Picchu, an hourglass tower in New York, a pleasure island in Baghdad … we reveal the architectural visions that were just too costly – or too weird", "published": "Thu 16 May 2024 14.13 CEST", "content": "Did you know that, if things had gone differently, the Pompidou Centre could have been an egg? In the 1969 competition for the Paris art centre – ultimately won by Richard Rogers and Renzo Piano, with their inside-out symphony of pipework – a radical French architect called André Bruyère submitted a proposal for a gigantic ovoid tower. His bulbous building would have risen 100 metres above the city’s streets, clad in shimmering scales of alabaster, glass and concrete, its walls swelling out in a curvaceous riposte to the tyranny of the straight line.“Time,” Bruyère declared, “instead of being linear, like the straight streets and vertical skyscrapers, will become oval, in tune with the egg.” His hallowed Oeuf would be held aloft on three chunky legs, while a monorail would pierce the facade and circle through the structure along a sinuous floating ribbon. The atrium was to take the form of an enclosed globe, like a yolk.Baghdad would have been Frank Lloyd Wright’s grandest project by far – had the king not been assassinated in a coup“Between the hard geometries,” Bruyère added, “comes the sweetness of a volume [with] curves in all directions, in contrast to these facades where the angle always falls right from the sky, always similar. So, the egg.” Sadly, it wasn’t to be. His ovular poetry didn’t impress the judges and Paris got its high-tech hymn to plumbing instead.L’Oeuf de Pompidou is one of many astonishing schemes to feature in Atlas of Never Built Architecture, a bulging compendium of dashed hopes and broken dreams that charts a fascinating alternative universe of “what ifs”. It is a world of runners-up and second bests, an encyclopaedia of hubristic plans that were too big, expensive or weird to make it off the drawing board.View image in fullscreenCracking idea … André Bruyère’s mega egg and Pompidou rival. Photograph: © Bruyère Fund. SIAF/City of Architecture and Heritage/Archives of Contemporary ArchitectureIt features best laid plans that became victims of political coups and economic crises, alongside the megalomaniacal visions of toppled tyrants, and projects that were scuppered by budget shortfalls, natural disasters and even a plane crash. It is a calamitous catalogue of corruption, bankruptcy and death, as well as a memorial to the untold hours of wasted work and unpaid labour that architects endure. But it all makes for a highly entertaining romp through what the world might have looked like, had fate chosen a different path.One spread depicts a fantastical vision of a pleasure island, where a needle-thin spire rises from the cone-shaped dome of an ornate pavilion, surrounded by lush gardens dotted with more glass domes. The central building is raised on a platform and engulfed by a reflecting pool, reached by a majestic spiral ramp, recalling the processional route to an ancient ziggurat. It looks like the glitzy dream of a wealthy desert petro-state. And it is – except that it’s not the work of a contemporary “starchitect” for the Gulf, but the vision of Frank Lloyd Wright, drawn up in 1957 for Baghdad.Schöffer described his skyscraping smartphone tower as 'an intense living flame, constantly transforming'Wright had been invited by King Faisal II to design an opera house for the city, alongside a range of other stars of the day, including Le Corbusier, Alvar Aalto, Gio Ponti and Walter Gropius, who had been commissioned to design universities, government buildings, sports complexes and other palaces of culture. On his descent into the airport, Wright noticed a long, thin island in the Tigris River – a location he thought preferable to the downtown site he had been allotted. “The island, Mr Wright, is yours,” replied the king.As was his habit, Wright quickly expanded his brief, concocting an entire Plan for Greater Baghdad, which he dubbed Edena. Along with the opera house, there would be a civic auditorium, a planetarium, art museums, a grand bazaar, gardens, fountains and tiered highways, all wrought in the curving language of caliph-era Baghdad, known as the Round City, when it was surrounded by concentric circular walls. It would have been Wright’s grandest project by far – if the king had not been assassinated in a coup in 1958. The architect himself died the following year, aged 91.View image in fullscreenA multimedia answer to the Eiffel Tower … Nicolas Schoffer’s blaring cybernetic skyscraper. Photograph: Nicolas SchofferThe book’s two authors, Los Angeles-based architecture writers Sam Lubell and Greg Goldin, have foraged far and wide to compile a collection with impressive geographic scope and depth, beyond the usual suspects. Their research led to a “shortlist” of 5,000 projects, which they distilled to 1,000, then cut to 350 for the book – one of Phaidon’s hefty atlas tomes, weighing in at 1.5kg, with a £100 price tag.The projects range from bold parliaments for African cities, to a futuristic hotel that would have hovered above Machu Picchu, as well as what the South Bank of the Thames might have looked like if the American PoMo doyen Philip Johnson had had his way (Answer: a cartoonish neo-brutalist fantasy of the Palace of Westminster, teeming with crenelated towers.) There are plenty of plans that didn’t materialise the first time around, but later realised elsewhere, as well as ideas that were far ahead of their time, but now prove to be unnervingly prescient.One was Hungarian-French artist Nicolas Schöffer’s Tour Lumière Cybernétique. This illuminated beacon would have been an interactive multimedia answer to the Eiffel Tower, a skyscraper-sized smartphone designed to broadcast a barrage of notifications across the skyline. Bristling with arrays of loudspeakers, flashing lights, smoke signals, moving rods, rotating mirrors and more than 5,000 projectors, the tower was designed to relay data concerning the weather, traffic, news and even citizens’ movements.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Design ReviewFree monthly newsletterOriginal, sustainable ideas and reflection from designers and crafters, plus clever, beautiful products for smarter livingEnter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He saw his beacon as a way to democratise information – which, he argued, was otherwise limited to those in control of government and production. But by the 1970s, the possibilities of cybernetics were increasingly seen as a menace, viewed as tools that would enable the invasion of privacy and limit personal freedoms. Schöffer’s tower might not have materialised, but its principles live on in the data-harvesting hubs of “smart cities”, less broadcast on public billboards than hidden away in anonymous data centres.Towers appear throughout the book, this most ambitious of building types being the one most likely to come a cropper – and often triggering unintended consequences. The endurance of New York’s cherished neoclassical Grand Central Terminal, for example, is in part thanks to the backlash prompted by a 1954 plan to replace it with a 109-storey circular skyscraper. The hourglass-shaped design, by the Chinese-American architect IM Pei, was commissioned by Robert Young, then chairman of the ailing New York City Railroad, who thought that not exploiting the air rights above the historic station was as foolish as owning “a stretch of farmland worth $100bn and never putting a plough to it”.View image in fullscreenEchoes of Parliament … Philip Johnson’s crenelated towers proposed for the south bank of the Thames. Photograph: Ned Paynter/Friends of San Diego ArchitecturePei’s project, dubbed the Hyperboloid due to its twisting form, would have been the world’s tallest and most expensive building at the time. But, facing plummeting profits and a Senate investigation of the industry’s decline, Young killed himself in 1958, dashing any hopes for the tower. Meanwhile, opposition to the plans helped spark the modern preservation movement, seeing the beloved terminal bestowed with landmark status in 1967.While Pei’s tower might have offered spectacular views over Manhattan, the same could probably not be said for the Indiana Tower, dreamed up by César Pelli in 1981. The Argentina-born architect, who would go on to design Kuala Lumpur’s iconic Petronas Towers, was brought in to conjure a landmark for Indianapolis to rival the St Louis Gateway Arch or Seattle’s Space Needle. His solution was a 228m-high obelisk of concrete and limestone, with a 2.8km walkway spiralling its way to the top, where visitors could look out across sprawling plains of Indiana farmland. “Like the Eiffel Tower in Europe, it will be the thing you must see,” Pelli claimed. “It will be known as well in Moscow as it is in Singapore!”If you're going to make it bad, don't make it bigLocals were not so impressed. Some thought it looked too much like a corncob, cementing the stereotype of Indiana as a rural backwater. Others compared it to an oil derrick, while one appeals court judge said it looked like a bundle of chickenwire. “If you’re going to make it bad,” said the president of the local architects’ society, “don’t make it big.”External consultants brought in to evaluate the viability of the project were equally blunt. “Structures you can get up in the top of and look out work in cities like Seattle,” they wrote, “where there are two mountain ranges and Puget Sound, but it may not be attractive in a midwestern location simply because there is not as much to see when you get up there.”The Italian master Carlo Scarpa was sanguine about his many unrealised plans. Not building was possibly the only way to ensure peace. “It is better to do nothing,” he said, discussing his unbuilt Civic Theatre for Vicenza. “That way everyone will be happy: the city council, because it has avoided the criticism that can be directed at those who do something ... the opposition, because it can say that the administration does nothing, after trumpeting the theatre; those who do not want the theatre, because it will not be there; those who do want it, because they can continue to complain that there is no theatre; and meanwhile dreaming, each on his own, of an ideal theatre, made in his own image and likeness.”Sometimes, the perfect project is better left in the imagination.

And I think that’s absolutely unacceptable,” the artist, known as Nemo, told reporters after being crowned the winner of the 68th Eurovision song contest. “We need to change that.”Asked who they would call first after their win, the 24-year-old responded swiftly and perhaps surprisingly: Beat Jans, Switzerland’s justice minister.“We need to have the representation in our politics as well,” said Nemo, adding that they were hoping to schedule a call with the minister to speak about the rights of people who identify as non-binary. “It’s really important that people feel seen.”On Wednesday a spokesperson for Jans said the minister had responded to the remarks in a text message to Nemo and had expressed a willingness to meet.“On Sunday Jans tried to reach Nemo by phone and also texted the singer to congratulate and confirm his intention after a meeting. Both sides are currently looking for a suitable date,” the spokesperson said.About 18 months ago the Swiss government rejected proposals to introduce a third gender or no-gender option on official records, arguing that the binary model of gender continued to be “strongly anchored” in Swiss society.Responding to two proposals from parliament, the governing Federal Council said: “The social preconditions for the introduction of a third gender or for a general waiver of the gender entry in the civil registry currently are not there.”The debate returned to Swiss headlines this week after the wide embrace of Nemo’s song The Code, which delves into the artist’s personal journey of breaking “the code” between genders.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Headlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

How less-gendered language is faring across EuropeRead more“A non-binary person who officially doesn’t exist in Switzerland has won Eurovision 2024 for us all with #BreakTheCode,” a Green party politician, Sibel Arslan, who in 2017 proposed allowing non-binary designations in Switzerland, wrote on social media.Arslan described the 2017 proposal as “more relevant than ever”, and urged the Federal Council to “act now”.The message was echoed by the youth wing of the Green Liberal party. “It’s time that Switzerland broke with its binary gender designation,” it said on X.Several countries recognise people who identify as non-binary in official documents, including Germany, which in 2018 began allowing people to register as “diverse”, and Australia, which allows people to choose between male, female and indeterminate on passports.After a tumultuous song contest that was at times overshadowed by controversy, Nemo highlighted another issue after a reporter said several fans had had their non-binary pride flags confiscated when they tried to bring them into the venue in Sweden.“That is unbelievable,” said Nemo, who waved the Swiss flag and the striped non-binary pride flag onstage. “I had to smuggle my flag in because Eurovision said no. I did it anyways.”The artist described it as a clear example of a “double standard”, adding: “Maybe Eurovision needs a little bit of fixing too, every now and then.”Earlier this week the European Commission described a decision to ban audience members from waving the EU flag at the grand final as “completely regrettable” and “mind-blowing”.Eurovision organisers pointed to the longstanding policy of allowing only the flags of participating countries and rainbow flags. “Due to heightened geopolitical tensions, the flag policy was more rigorously enforced by security at this year’s event,” it said in a statement.Explore more on these topicsSwitzerlandTransgenderGenderEurovision 2024EurovisionEuropenewsShareReuse this content", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/may/16/eurovision-winner-nemo-urges-switzerland-to-bring-in-third-gender"},

They plan to marry in September and move to Spain Tell us your story of how you met someone special", "published": "Thu 16 May 2024 12.00 CEST", "content": "When Philippa moved to Sheffield from London in 2018, one of the first things she did was join her local Labour party. “I was studying for a PhD in housing and planning and was already involved in a tenants’ union,” she says. “I was very active socially, but I lived alone, so it was a bit lonely for me.”A year after moving up north, she began supporting the 2019 general election campaign. “We’d send groups from different areas to go leafleting and door knocking,” she says. “Olivia Blake, who we’d been supporting, won her seat, so she put on a little victory party just before Christmas.”Although she was happy to see Blake win her seat, Philippa admits it was a “sad event” because the Conservatives had won the general election by such a landslide. “I’d gone out in the cold to have doors slammed in my face,” she says. “The overall mood was quite low.” Afterwards the group went to a nearby bar and she started crying. “I was really hungry and overwhelmed. When they didn’t have any pizza, it put me over the edge.”That’s when she met Jack for the first time. “He campaigned for the election too, but we’d been door knocking in different areas, so I hadn’t seen him before. He put his arm around me and said it was OK. Then we sat down and chatted for the rest of the night,” she says.She discovered that he worked for a local theatre company, alongside his job in a bookstore. “At the time, I was looking for something with more security, and applying for teaching assistant jobs,” he remembers. They quickly bonded over their shared values and interest in politics. “Philippa seemed like an exciting person and I thought I’d really enjoy spending more time with her.” Despite their connection, they didn’t exchange numbers that night, and Philippa went home to get something to eat.Share your experienceShare your storyTell us everything below.

She was going away, but we exchanged numbers to meet up in the new year.”Their first date went perfectly. “I really felt he was someone who understood me,” says Philippa. “He had a very open heart and a strong moral core.” Jack admits he was incredibly nervous. “It was like being a teenager. I had heart palpitations at first, but we laughed a lot straight away.”From then on, they started seeing each other a few times a week. “We had a conversation the first evening about being exclusive, so I never had any questions about what either of us wanted. We knew it was going somewhere straight away,” says Philippa. Neither had the money for expensive dates, so they spent a lot of time at each other’s flats eating dinner together.When the pandemic hit in March 2020, they made the decision to isolate together. “I went to stay with him and then immediately got sick with flu-like symptoms,” she says. “We had no idea if it was Covid as there were no tests. Luckily, I got better quite quickly and we stayed in lockdown together.” Bar a few tensions over shared work spaces, they got on “really well” and the experience cemented their relationship.As well as their shared interest in politics and social justice, they love hiking, going out dancing or to gigs, and keeping fit at parkrun. “We like to travel when we can. Our first holiday was camping in a village in the Peak District, and since then we’ve been to Greece, Slovenia, Whitby and lots of festivals,” says Jack.After four years living in Sheffield together, they plan to move to Spain in September. “I’ve been awarded a postdoctoral fellowship for two years near Barcelona, and Jack’s going to come,” says Philippa. Jack, who qualified as a teacher in 2022, hopes to get a job at a local school. They plan to marry in Sheffield before they leave.“The number one thing I admire about Jack is his creativity and sense of optimism. He sees the best in situations and assumes the best in others,” says Philippa. “It helps me to be more generous, less cynical and more open-hearted. I love being in a team with Jack, because we have fun together and always have each other’s back.”Jack has “never known anyone as tenacious as Phil”. “She thinks everyone deserves the best and is not easily defeated. I think a lot more seems possible than if I was going about this life alone.”Explore more on these topicsRelationshipsHow we metLabourfeaturesShareReuse this content", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/article/2024/may/16/how-we-met-i-cried-because-the-bar-didnt-have-any-pizza-and-he-comforted-me"},

But the tense atmosphere of hatred was our collective work.”As reported earlier, president-elect Peter Pellegrini has called on political parties to suspend or scale back their campaigns for European elections. At the press conference he said this would prevent “stand-offs and mutual accusations between politicians,” prior the elections, which will be held on 6-9 June.“If there is anything that the people of Slovakia urgently need today, it is at least basic agreement and unity among the Slovak political representation.

He said on Thursday afternoon that Fico was in a stable condition but that it was too early to say the outlook was positive. “He’s still not out of the woods yet,” he said.“Unfortunately I cannot say yet that we are winning or that the prognosis is positive because the extent of the injuries caused by four gunshot wounds is so extensive that the body’s response will still be very difficult.”The shooting comes three weeks before European parliament elections, with polls suggesting that populist and hard-right parties in the 27-nation bloc will make gains.mapOn Thursday, Peter Pellegrini, Slovakia’s president-elect and an ally of Fico, called on parties to suspend or tone down their campaigning.“I am calling on all political parties in Slovakia to temporarily suspend or considerably reduce their European election campaign,” Pellegrini said in a statement, adding Slovakia should avoid “further confrontation”.Local media identified the alleged shooter as Juraj Cintula, 71, from Levice in south-central Slovakia. He is said to be a former security guard at a shopping centre, the author of three books of poetry, and to have spoken on YouTube of his desire to form a political movement.On Thursday, several police officers were stationed at the entrance of the unassuming grey apartment block where Cintula had lived for 40 years.The news outlet Aktuality.sk cited the suspect’s son as saying his father was the legal holder of a gun licence.In an undated video posted on Facebook, a man – whom Reuters verified as the alleged attacker – was seen saying: “I do not agree with government policy.”Fico was taken to a hospital in the city of Banská Bystrica after the shooting. Hours later, Kaliňák said medical workers were “fighting for the life” of Fico. He described the shooting as a clear “political assault”.Who is Robert Fico? Read moreOn Thursday morning, Miriam Lapunikova, the director of the hospital, said the prime minister had undergone five hours of surgery with two teams to treat multiple gunshot wounds. Slovakian media reported that Fico was placed in an artificial coma after the operation.“At this point his condition is stabilised but is truly very serious, he will be in the intensive care unit,” Lapunikova said.Kaliňák told reporters outside the hospital: “During the night doctors managed to stabilise the patient’s condition. Unfortunately his condition continues to be very serious due to the complicated nature of the wounds, but we all want to believe firmly that we will succeed in managing the situation.”Late on Wednesday, the deputy prime minister, Tomáš Taraba, told the BBC that Fico was expected to survive. “He was heavily injured – one bullet went through the stomach and the second one hit the joint. Immediately he was transported to the hospital and then to the operation.”As Slovaks commuted to work on Thursday, many were still processing the news. Mária Szabó, a shopkeeper in Bratislava, said: “I don’t have words for this. This should never have happened in the 21st century, no matter who you vote for.

Photograph: Radovan Stoklasa/ReutersFico, a veteran populist politician, returned to power in elections last year after promises not to send “another bullet” to Ukraine, criticism of sanctions targeting Russia, and campaigns against LGBTQ+ rights.The first months of his return have proved divisive, with thousands of people taking to streets across the country to protest against measures that critics have warned will imperil freedom of the press, and the elimination of a special prosecutor post that deals with major crime and corruption.Fico has fiercely criticised Slovakia’s mainstream media and refused to speak to some outlets, while members of his party have taken aim at media and opposition actions in recent months.The tensions were heightened by last month’s hard-fought presidential elections in which Fico tightened his grip on power as his ally Pellegrini won.Eštok, the interior minister, said on Wednesday that the country was “on the edge of a civil war”, adding: “Such hateful comments are being made on social networks today, so please, let’s stop this immediately.”Eštok described the assassination attempt as politically motivated, telling reporters that the “perpetrator’s decision was born closely after the presidential election”.The Slovak president, Zuzana Čaputová, said she would invite all parliamentary party leaders for a joint meeting in an attempt to “calm” the political tensions that have been exacerbated after the shooting.“Let us step out of the vicious circle of hatred and mutual accusations,” she said at a news conference in Bratislava. “What happened yesterday was an individual act. But the tense atmosphere of hatred was our collective work.”She made her statement alongside Pellegrini, her political rival, in a joint effort to temper the recent political tensions.Gábor Czímer, a political journalist at the Slovakian news outlet Ujszo.com, told the Associated Press that Fico’s return to power had laid bare how “Slovak society is strongly split into two camps” – one that was friendly towards Russia and another that pushed for stronger connections with the EU and the west.“At the same time, I couldn’t imagine that it would lead to physical violence,” Czímer said.The shooting – the first major assassination attempt on a European political leader in more than 20 years – sent shock waves across Europe, with leaders linking the violence to an increasingly febrile and polarised political climate across the continent.In Germany, where three elected officials were recently assaulted in less than a week, the chancellor, Olaf Scholz, said he had been left reeling by Fico’s shooting. “Violence must have no place in European politics,” he wrote on X.Explore more on these topicsSlovakiaRobert FicoEuropenewsShareReuse this content", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/may/16/slovakia-robert-fico-stable-serious-condition-shooting"},

It is a homophobic state.” Homosexuality is illegal in Qatar.Qatari police say they found the 44-year-old in possession of methamphetamine, and that he was arrested under the country’s drug laws. “The arrest in question and subsequent investigation are related solely to the possession and distribution of illegal substances, with no involvement of other factors,” a Qatari official told the Guardian. They claim to have become aware of Aviña’s sexuality after his arrest.Enrique said his brother was not a drug user, was made to sign documents in Arabic that he did not understand and was pressed into saying the drugs were his. He said the authorities also tried to pressure Aviña’ into naming other gay men. “Why were they interrogating him about gay men if he was being held on a drugs charge?”Amnesty International has described Aviña’’s experience in detention as “nothing short of horrific”. A rally to show support for Aviña and raise awareness of his case is planned outside the Foreign Office in London this afternoon.Enrique said that blood tests taken while his brother was being held in February showed the HIV virus was present – a direct result of not being able to access his medication. He said the antiretroviral (ARV) medication his brother needs to treat his HIV is not routinely available in Qatar, and Aviña relied on getting the medication abroad as part of his job as a flight attendant for Qatar Airways. His only way of accessing the medication now is if Enrique gives it to the Qatari authorities. “I handed [it] over, but [it] never reached my brother,” Enrique said. The Qatari authorities did not answer questions from the Guardian about the provision of HIV medicine within the country.The UN’s Working Group on Arbitrary Detention released a statement, which said they had “deep concerns” about the reportedly discriminatory motives of the alleged arrest, detention, and ill-treatment of Aviña, including his reported denial of access to lifesaving ARV medications.After spending 44 days in prison, Aviña was released to await trial in June. Enrique has been told his brother faces a sentence of anything between six months to three years if found guilty. “I fear his health will collapse if he cannot get access to his medication in prison.”‘Every day I cry’: 50 women talk about life as a domestic worker under the Gulf’s kafala system Read moreAmnesty International has raised concerns about whether Aviña was targeted through a dating app, and whether due process was followed in his case. Dana Ahmed, who is leading the case for Amnesty International, said: “Manuel repeatedly asked for a lawyer during his time in detention but did not have an opportunity to take legal advice for more than a month after his detention.“He had no access to any documents relating to his case for more than two months following his arrest and only days before his first trial session, violating his right to a genuine opportunity to prepare and present his defence.Ahmed said Amnesty fears Aviña was coerced in his interrogation to provide the authorities with information that they could use to pursue a crackdown on LGBTQ+ individuals in Qatar. “Why else would security officials force Manuel to unlock his phone and identify members of the LGBTQ+ community during his interrogation?” Ahmed said.Human Rights Watch released a report last year into the use of digital entrapment through dating apps to target gay citizens in the Middle East. “The criminalisation of same-sex conduct emboldens digital targeting, quells LGBT expression online and offline, and serves as the basis for prosecutions of LGBT people,” the report said.Explore more on these topicsLGBTQ+ rightsRights and freedomQatarMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/article/2024/may/16/nothing-short-of-horrific-amnesty-criticise-arrest-of-man-in-qatar-trapped-by-police-on-grindr"}
